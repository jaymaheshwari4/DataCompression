 CHAPTER ONE 
Dudley Demented
The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay
over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood
dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing 
for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual carwashing and lawnmowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the
shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent
breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in
a flowerbed outside number four.
He was a skinny, blackhaired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy
look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and
dirty, his Tshirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from
the uppers. Harry Potter's appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the
sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had
hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to
passersby. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt
Petunia stuck their heads out of the livingroom window and looked straight down into
the flowerbed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He
was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand,
nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news,
or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down
in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley,
Harry's uncle, suddenly spoke.
'Glad to see the boy's stopped trying to butt in. Where is he, anyway?'
'I don't know,' said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned. 'Not in the house.'
Uncle Vernon grunted.
'Watching the news …' he said scathingly. 'I'd like to know what he's really up to. As if a
normal boy cares what's on the news Dudley hasn't got a clue what's going on; doubt he
knows who the Prime Minister is! Anyway, it's not as if there'd be anything about his lot
on our news  '
'Vernon, shh!' said Aunt Petunia. The window's open!'
'Oh  yes  sorry, dear.' 
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit 'n' Bran breakfast cereal
while he watched Mrs Figg, a batty catloving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk,
amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased he
was concealed behind the bush, as Mrs Figg had recently taken to asking him round for
tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and vanished from
view before Uncle Vernon's voice floated out of the window again.
'Dudders out for tea?'
'At the Polkisses',' said Aunt Petunia fondly. 'He's got so many little friends, he's so
popular
Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid
about their son, Dudley. They had swallowed all his dimwitted lies about having tea with
a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly
well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening
vandalising the play park, smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars
and children. Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging;
he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from
bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o'clock news reached Harry's ears
and his stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight  after a month of waiting  would be the
night.
'Record numbers of stranded holiday makers fill airports as the Spanish baggagehandlers' strike reaches its second week 
'Give 'em a lifelong siesta, I would,' snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the
newsreader's sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harrys stomach seemed to
unclench. If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news;
death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers.
He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this
summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then
mounting tension again… and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question
of why nothing had happened yet.
He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognised for what it really
was by the Muggles  an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident…
but the baggagehandlers' strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast
('I hope he's listening next door!' bellowed Uncle Vernon. 'Him with his sprinklers on at
three in the morning!'), then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then
a famous actress's divorce from her famous husband ('As if we're interested in their
sordid affairs,' sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every
magazine she could lay her bony hands on). 
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, ' and
finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who
lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water ski! Mary Dorkins went to
find out more.'
Harry opened his eyes. If they had reached waterskiing budgerigars, there would be
nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously on to his front and raised himself on to
his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window.
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from
under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of
breaking china came from the Dursleys' living room, and as though this was the signal
Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the
waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword  but before
he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys'
open window. The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to
focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright
when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around
his throat.
'Put  it  away!' Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear. 'Now.' Before  anyone  sees!'
'Get  off  me!' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his
uncles sausagelike fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his
raised wand; then, as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb,
Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock.
Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible
to hold.
Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around.
There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several
faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into
his jeans and tried to look innocent.
'Lovely evening!' shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs Number Seven opposite, who
was glaring from behind her net curtains. 'Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave
Petunia and me quite a turn!'
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbours had
disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he
beckoned Harry back towards him. 
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle
Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling.
'What the devil do you mean by it, boy?' asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that
trembled with fury.
'What do I mean by what?' said Harry coldly. He kept looking left and right up the street,
still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise.
'Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our 
'I didn't make that noise,' said Harry firmly.
Aunt Petunia's thin, horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon's wide, purple one.
She looked livid.
'Why were you lurking under our window?'
'Yes  yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?'
'Listening to the news,' said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
'Listening to the news! Again?'
'Well, it changes every day, you see,' said Harry.
'Don't you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you're really up to  and don't
give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your
lot 
'Careful, Vernon!' breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that
Harry could barely hear him,' that your lot don't get on our news!'
'That's all you know,' said Harry.
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, 'You're a nasty
little liar. What are all those ' she, too, lowered her voice so that Harry had to lipread the
next word,  owls doing if they're not bringing you news?'
'Aha!' said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. 'Get out of that one, boy! As if we
didn't know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!'
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the truth this time, even
though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he felt at admitting it. 
'The owls… aren't bringing me news,' he said tonelessly.
'I don't believe it,' said Aunt Petunia at once.
'No more do I,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
'We know you're up to something funny,' said Aunt Petunia.
'We're not stupid, you know,' said Uncle Vernon.
'Well, that's news to me,' said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call
him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall
and was striding off up the street.
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and
pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at the moment; he had
much more pressing matters on his mind.
Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or
Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the houseelf made when he vanished into
thin air. Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following
him right at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared
back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted and Harry was sure
that Dobby did not know how to become invisible.
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had pounded these streets
so often lately that his feet carried him to his favourite haunts automatically. Every few
steps he glanced back over his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay
among Aunt Petunia's dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn't they spoken to him,
why hadn't they made contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked away.
Perhaps it hadn't been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so desperate for the
tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply
overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. Could he be sure it hadn't been the sound of
something breaking inside a neighbour's house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of
hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again.
Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o'clock so he could pay the
owl that delivered the Daily Prophet but was there any point continuing to take it? Harry
merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who
ran the paper finally realised that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and
that was the only kind Harry cared about. 
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and
Hermione, though any expectation he'd had that their letters would bring him news had
long since been dashed.
We can't say much about youknowwhat, obviously… We've been told not to say
anything important in case our letters go astray… We're quite busy but I can't give you
details here… There's a fair amount going on, we'll tell you everything when we see
you…
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date.
Hermione had scribbled I expect we'll be seeing you quite soon inside his birthday card,
but how soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters,
Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron's parents' house. He could
hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in
Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry with them he had thrown away, unopened, the two
boxes of Honeydukes chocolates they'd sent him for his birthday. He'd regretted it later,
after the wilted salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn't he, Harry, busy? Hadn't he
proved himself capable of handling much more than them? Had they all forgotten what
he had done? Hadn't it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being
murdered, and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed?
Don't think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth lime that summer. It
was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling
on it in his waking moments too.
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway
down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at
least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling. Admittedly, his letters were just as
empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione's, but at least they contained words of
caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints:
I know this must be frustrating for you… Keep your nose clean and everything will be
OK… Be careful and don't do anything rash…
Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and
headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and .large) done as Sirius advised.
He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for
The Burrow by himself. In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long,
reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to
what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be
rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped,
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on
the run with a stolen Hippogriff. 
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park
was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings he sank on to the
only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm
around the chain and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the
Dursleys' flowerbed again. Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of
listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another
restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he
had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked
doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he
was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool
himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more. In the
past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that
Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only
to be expected… nothing to worry about… old news…
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn't
been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And his reward was
to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical
world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear about waterskiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron
and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too? How much longer was he
supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the
temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had
returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry's head, and his insides writhed
with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry
grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park
railings.
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted
his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a
misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the
park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft
ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin,
Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year's hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had
wrought quite a change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who
would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight InterSchool Boxing
Champion of the Southeast. The noble sport', as Uncle Vernon called it, had made
Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days
when he had served as Dudley's first punchball. Harry was not remotely afraid of his
cousin any more but he still didn't think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more
accurately was cause for celebration. Neighbourhood children all around were terrified of
him  even more terrified than they were of 'that Potter boy' who, they had been warned, 
was a hardened hooligan and attended St Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal
Boys.
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been
beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as he watched them. Come
on… look round… I'm sitting here all alone… come and have a go…
If Dudley's friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him,
and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn't want to lose face in front of the gang, but
he'd be terrified of provoking Harry… it would be really fun to watch Dudley's dilemma,
to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond… and if any of the others tried
hitting Harry, he was ready  he had his wand. Let them try… he'd love to vent some of
his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell.
But they didn't turn around, they didn't see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry
mastered the impulse to call after them… seeking a fight was not a smart move… he
must not use magic… he would be risking expulsion again.
The voices of Dudley's gang died away; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia
Road.
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the
opposite of what you'd have done.
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that
whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and any time after that was
much too late. Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home
after Dudley ever again, so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off towards the
park gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly
manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to
Uncle Vernon's. Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows
made patches of jewelbright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing
disapproving mutters about his 'delinquent' appearance when he passed the householders.
He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley's gang came into view
again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry
stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
'… squealed like a pig, didn't he?' Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others.
'Nice right hook, Big D,' said Piers.
'Same time tomorrow?' said Dudley.
'Round at my place, my parents will be out,' said Gordon. 
'See you then,' said Dudley.
'Bye, Dud!'
'See ya, Big D!'
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their
voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by
walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling
along at his ease, humming tunelessly.
'Hey, Big D!'
Dudley turned.
'Oh,' he grunted. 'It's you.'
'How long have you been "Big D" then?' said Harry.
'Shut it,' snarled Dudley, turning away.
'Cool name,' said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin. 'But you'll
always be "Ickle Diddykins" to me.'
'I said, SHUT IT!' said Dudley, whose hamlike hands had curled into fists.
'Don't the boys know that's what your mum calls you?'
'Shut your face.'
'You don't tell her to shut her face. What about "Popkin" and "Dinky Diddydums", can I
use them then?'
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand
all his selfcontrol.
'So who've you been beating up tonight?' Harry asked, his grin fading. 'Another tenyearold? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago 
'He was asking for it,' snarled Dudley.
'Oh yeah?'
'He cheeked me.' 
'Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 'Cause
that's not cheek, Dud, that's true.'
A muscle was twitching in Dudley's jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know
how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own
frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which
formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and
much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps
were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.
Think you're a big man carrying that thing, don't you?' Dudley said after a few seconds.
'What thing?'
'That  that thing you are hiding.'
Harry grinned again.
'Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I's'pose, if you were, you wouldn't be able
to walk and talk at the same time.'
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
'You're not allowed,' Dudley said at once. 'I know you're not. You'd get expelled from
that freak school you go to.'
'How d'you know they haven't changed the rules, Big D?'
They haven't,' said Dudley, though he didn't sound completely convinced.
Harry laughed softly.
'You haven't got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?' Dudley snarled.
'Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old. You
know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven?
Eight?'
'He was sixteen, for your information,' snarled Dudley, 'and he was out cold for twenty
minutes after I'd finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I
tell Dad you had that thing out 
'Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry's
wand?' 
'Not this brave at night, are you?' sneered Dudley.
This is night, Diddykins. That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this.'
'I mean when you're in bed!' Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.
From the little he could see of Dudley's large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant
look.
'What d'you mean, I'm not brave when I'm in bed?' said Harry, completely nonplussed.
'What am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?'
'I heard you last night,' said Dudley breathlessly. Talking in your sleep. Moaning.'
'What d'you mean?' Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his
stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a highpitched whimpering voice.
'"Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill Cedric!" Who's Cedric  your boyfriend?'
'I  you're lying,' said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley
wasn't lying  how else would he know about Cedric?
'"Dad! Help me, Dad! He's going to kill me, Dad! Boo hoo!"'
'Shut up,' said Harry quietly. 'Shut up, Dudley, I'm warning you!'
''Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He's killed Cedric! Dad, help me!
He's going to " Don't you point that thing at me!'
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley's
heart. Harry could feel fourteen years' hatred of Dudley pounding in his veins  what
wouldn't he give to strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he'd have to crawl home like
an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers…
'Don't ever talk about that again,' Harry snarled. 'D'you understand me?'
'Point that thing somewhere else!'
'I said, do you understand me?'
'Point it somewhere else!' 
'DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?'
'GET THAT THING AWAY FROM '
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been doused in icy water.
Something had happened to the night. The starstrewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch
black and lightless  the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley
had vanished. The distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy
evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total,
impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle
over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact
that he'd been resisting as hard as he could  then his reason caught up with his senses 
he didn't have the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that, trying
to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil.
Dudley's terrified voice broke in Harry's ear.
'Wwhat are you ddoing? Ststop it!'
'I'm not doing anything! Shut up and don't move!'
'I ccan't see! I've ggone blind! I '
'I said shut up!'
Harry stood stock still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The cold was so intense
he was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back
of his neck were standing up  he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly
around, unseeing.
It was impossible… they couldn't be here… not in Little Whinging… he strained his
ears… he would hear them before he saw them…
'I'll'ttell Dad!' Dudley whimpered. 'Wwhere are you? What are you ddo?'
'Will you shut up?' Harry hissed, I'm trying to lis'
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing
long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in
the freezing air. 
'Ccut it out! Stop doing it! I'll hhit you, I swear I will!'
'Dudley, shut'
WHAM.
A fist made contact with the side of Harrys head, lifting him off his feet. Small white
lights popped in front of his eyes. For the second time in an hour Harry felt as though his
head had been cleaved in two; next moment, he had landed hard on the ground and his
wand had flown out of his hand.
'You moron, Dudley!' Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his
hands and knees, feeling around frantically in the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering
away, hitting the alley fence, stumbling.
'DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU'RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!'
There was a horrible squealing yell and Dudley's footsteps stopped. At the same moment,
Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing. There was more
than one.
'DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR
MOUTH SHUT! Wand!' Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like
spiders. 'Where's  wand come on  lumos!'
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search  and to his
disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand  the wand tip had ignited.
Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet and turned around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him, hovering over the ground,
no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came.
Stumbling backwards, Harry raised his wand.
'Expecto patronum!'
A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed, but the
spell hadn't worked properly; tripping over his own feet, Harry retreated further as the
Dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain  concentrate 
A pair of grey, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the Dementor's robes, reaching for
him. A rushing noise filled Harry's ears.
'Expecto patronum!' 
His voice sounded dim and distant. Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last,
drifted from the wand  he couldn't do it any more, he couldn't work the spell.
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, highpitched laughter… he could smell
the Dementor's putrid, deathcold breath filling his own lungs, drowning him  think…
something happy…
But there was no happiness in him… the Dementor's icy fingers were closing on his
throat  the highpitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke
inside his head: 'Bow to death, Harry…it might even be painless… I would not know … I
have never died …"
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again 
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath.
'EXPECTO PATRONUM!'
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry's wand; its antlers caught the
Dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backwards,
weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the Dementor swooped away, batlike
and defeated.
'THIS WAY!' Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the
alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. 'DUDLEY? DUDLEY!'
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the
ground, his arms clamped over his face. A second Dementor was crouching low over
him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prising them slowly almost lovingly apart,
lowering its hooded head towards Dudley's face as though about to kiss him.
'GET IT!' Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had
conjured came galloping past him. The Dementor's eyeless face was barely an inch from
Dudley's when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like
its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end
of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway.
Trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia
Crescent filled the air again.
Harry stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality.
After a moment, he became aware that his Tshirt was sticking to him; he was drenched
in sweat.
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in Little Whinging. 
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. Harry bent down to see
whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then he heard loud, running footsteps behind
him. Instinctively raising his wand again, he span on his heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs Figg, their batty old neighbour, came panting into sight. Her grizzled grey hair was
escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist
and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand
hurriedly out of sight, but 
'Don't put it away idiot boy!' she shrieked. 'What if there are more of them around? Oh,
I'm going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!'
 CHAPTER TWO
A Peck of Owls
'What?' said Harry blankly.
'He left!' said Mrs Figg, wringing her hands. 'Left to see someone about a batch of
cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom! I told him I'd flay him alive if he went, and
now look! Dementors! It's just lucky I put Mr Tibbies on the case! But we haven't got
time to stand around! Hurry, now, we've got to get you back! Oh, the trouble this is going
to cause! I will kill him!'
'But ' The revelation that his batty old catobsessed neighbour knew what Dementors
were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway.
'You're  you're a witch?'
'I'm a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was I supposed to help you
fight off Dementors? He left you completely without cover when I'd warned him '
This Mundungus has been following me? Hang on  it was him! He Disapparated from
the front of my house!'
'Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I'd stationed Mr Tibbies under a car just in case, and Mr
Tibbies came and warned me, but by the time I got to your house you'd gone  and now 
oh, what's Dumbledore going to say? You!' she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the
alley floor. 'Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!'
'You know Dumbledore?' said Harry, staring at her.
'Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn't know Dumbledore? But come on  I'll be no
help if they come back, I've never so much as Transfigured a teabag.'
She stooped down, seized one of Dudley's massive arms in her wizened hands and
tugged. 
'Get up, you useless lump, get up!'
But Dudley either could not or would not move. He remained on the ground, trembling
and ashenfaced, his mouth shut very tight.
'I'll do it.' Harry took hold of Dudley's arm and heaved. With an enormous effort he
managed to hoist him to his feet. Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting. His small
eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let
go of him he swayed dangerously.
'Hurry up!' said Mrs Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of Dudley's massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him
towards the road, sagging slightly under the weight. Mrs Figg tottered along in front of
them, peering anxiously around the corner.
'Keep your wand out,' she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria Walk. 'Never mind the
Statute of Secrecy now, there's going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be
hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage
Sorcery… this was exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of  What's that at the end of the
street? Oh, it's just Mr Prentice… don't put your wand away, boy, don't w keep telling you
I'm no use?'
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul Dudley along at the same time. Harry
gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for
independent movement. He was slumped on Harry's shoulder, his large feet dragging
along the ground.
'Why didn't you tell me you're a Squib, Mrs Figg?' asked Harry, panting with the effort to
keep walking. 'All those times I came round your house  why didn't you say anything?'
'Dumbledore's orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too
young. I'm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, Harry, but the Dursleys would never
have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it. It wasn't easy, you know… but oh my
word,' she said tragically, wringing her hands once more, 'when Dumbledore hears about
this  how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be on duty until midnight 
where is he? How am I going to tell Dumbledore what's happened? I can't Apparate.'
'I've got an owl, you can borrow her.' Harry groaned, wondering whether his spine was
going to snap under Dudleys weight.
'Harry, you don't understand! Dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible, the
Ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic, they'll know already, you
mark my words.' 
'But I was getting rid of Dementors, I had to use magic  they're going to be more worried
about what Dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk, surely?'
'Oh, my dear, I wish it were so, but I'm afraid  MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER, I AM
GOING TO KILL YOU!'
There was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the
air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them. He
had short, bandy legs, long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him
the doleful look of a basset hound. He was also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry
recognised at once as an Invisibility Cloak.
'S'up, Figgy?' he said, staring from Mrs Figg to Harry and Dudley. 'What 'appened to
staying undercover?'
Til give you undercover]' cried Mrs Figg. 'Dementors, you useless, skiving sneak thief!'
'Dementors?' repeated Mundungus, aghast. 'Dementors, 'ere?'
'Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!' shrieked Mrs Figg. 'Dementors
attacking the boy on your watch!'
'Blimey,' said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs Figg to Harry, and back again.
'Blimey, I '
'And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn't I tell you not to go? Didn't IT
'I  well, I ' Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. 'It  it was a very good business
opportunity, see '
Mrs Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus
around the face and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat
food.
'Ouch  gerroff  gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone's gotta tell Dumbledore!'
'Yes  they  have!' yelled Mrs Figg, swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of
Mundungus she could reach. 'And  it  had
 better  be  you  and  you  can  tell  him  why  you weren't  there  to  help!'
'Keep your 'airnet on!' said Mundungus, his arms over his head, cowering. 'I'm going, I'm
going!'
And with another loud crack, he vanished. 
'I hope Dumbledore murders him!' said Mrs Figg furiously. 'Now come on, Harry, what
are you waiting for?'
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk
under Dudley's bulk. He gave the semiconscious Dudley a heave and staggered onwards.
'I'll take you to the door,' said Mrs Figg, as they turned into Privet Drive. 'Just in case
there are more of them around… oh my word, what a catastrophe… and you had to fight
them off yourself… and Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all
costs… well, it's no good crying over spilt potion, w suppose… but the cat's among the
pixies now.'
'So,' Harry panted, 'Dumbledore's… been having… me followed?'
'Of course he has,' said Mrs Figg impatiently. 'Did you expect him to let you wander
around on your own after what happened in June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you
were intelligent… right… get inside and stay there,' she said, as they reached number
four. 'I expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.'
'What are you going to do?' asked Harry quickly.
'I'm going straight home,' said Mrs Figg, staring around the dark street and shuddering.
'I'll need to wait for more instructions. Just stay in the house. Goodnight.'
'Hang on, don't go yet! I want to know 
But Mrs Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, string bag clanking.
'Wait!' Harry shouted after her. He had a million questions to ask anyone who was in
contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds Mrs Figg was swallowed by the darkness.
Scowling, Harry readjusted Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up
number four's garden path.
The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang
the bell and watched Aunt Petunia's outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the
rippling glass in the front door.
'Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite  quite  Diddy, what's the matter!'
Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time. Dudley
swayed on the spot for a moment, his face pale green… then he opened his mouth and
vomited all over the doormat.
'DIDDY! Diddy, what's the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!' 
Harry's uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus moustache blowing
hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated. He hurried forwards to help
Aunt Petunia negotiate a weakkneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping
in the pool of sick.
'He's ill, Vernon!'
'What is it, son? What's happened? Did Mrs Polkiss give you something foreign for tea?'
'Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on the ground?'
'Hang on  you haven't been mugged, have you, son?'
Aunt Petunia screamed.
'Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak to Mummy! What did
they do to you?'
In all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which suited him perfectly. He
managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and, while the
Dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen, Harry moved
carefully and quietly towards the stairs.
'Who did it, son? Give us names. We'll get them, don't worry.'
'Shh! He's trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell Mummy!'
Harry's foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his voice.
'Him.'
Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the explosion.
'BOY! COME HERE!'
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot slowly from the stair
and turned to follow the Dursleys.
The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside.
Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green and clammylooking. Uncle Vernon standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through
tiny, narrowed eyes.
'What have you done to my son?' he said in a menacing growl.
'Nothing,' said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn't believe him. 
'What did he do to you, Diddy?' Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice, now sponging
sick from the front of Dudley's leather jacket. 'Was it  was it youknowwhat, darling?
Did he use  his thing?'
Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
'I didn't!' Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and
Uncle Vernon raised his fists. 'I didn't do anything to him, it wasn't me, it was 
But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window.
Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon's head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped
the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry's feet, turned gracefully,
the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off
across the garden.
'OWLS!' bellowed Uncle Vernon, the wellworn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he
slammed the kitchen window shut. 'OWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE
OWLS IN MY HOUSE!'
But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside, his
heart pounding somewhere in the region of his Adam's apple.
Dear Mr Potter,
We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twentythree
minutes past nine this evening in a Muggleinhabited area and in the presence of a
Muggle.
The seventy of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage
Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion
from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will be
calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.
As you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under Section ww
of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform
you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at w
a.m. on the twelfth of August.
Hoping you are well,
Yours sincerely,
Mafalda Hopkirk 
Improper Use of Magic Office
Ministry of Magic
Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia talking. Inside his head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his
consciousness like a paralysing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all over. He
was never going back.
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purplefaced, shouting, his fists still
raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was retching again.
Harry's temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry representatives will be
calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand. There was only one thing
for it. He would have to run  now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn't know, but he
was certain of one thing: at Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an almost
dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen.
'Where d'you think you're going?' yelled Uncle Vernon. When Harry didn't reply, he
pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. 'I haven't finished with
you, boy!'
'Get out of the way,' said Harry quietly.
'You're going to stay here and explain how my son '
'If you don't get out of the way I'm going to jinx you,' said Harry, raising the wand.
'You can't pull that one on me!' snarled Uncle Vernon. 'I know you're not allowed to use
it outside that madhouse you call a school!'
The madhouse has chucked me out,' said Harry. 'So I can do whatever I like. You've got
three seconds. One  two '
A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen. Aunt Petunia screamed,
I hide Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night Harry was searching for
the source of a disturbance he had not made. He spotted it at once: a dazed and ruffledlooking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the
closed window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon's anguished yell of 'OWLS!' Harry crossed the room at a run and
wrenched the window open. The owl stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment
was tied, shook its leathers, and took off the moment Harry had taken the letter. Hands
shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily
in black ink. 
Harry 
Dumbledore's just arrived at the Ministry and he's trying to sort it all out. DO NOT
LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC. DO
NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND. Arthur Weasley
Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out… what did that mean? How much power did
Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of Magic? Was there a chance that he might be
allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry's chest,
almost immediately strangled by panic  how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his
wand without doing magic? He'd have to duel with the Ministry representatives, and if he
did that, he'd be lucky to escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion.
His mind was racing… he could run for it and risk being caplured by the Ministry, or
stay put and wait for them to find him here. He was much more tempted by the former
course, but he knew Mr Weasley had his best interests at heart… and after all,
Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before.
'Right,' Harry said, 'I've changed my mind, I'm staying.' He flung himself down at the
kitchen table and faced Dudley and Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at
his abrupt change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. The vein
in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever.
'Who are all these ruddy owls from?' he growled.
The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,' said Harry calmly. He was
straining his ears to catch any noises outside, in case the Ministry representatives were
approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon's questions than to
have him start raging and bellowing. 'The second one was from my friend Ron's dad, who
works at the Ministry.'
'Ministry of Magic?' bellowed Uncle Vernon. 'People like you in government! Oh, this
explains everything, everything, no wonder the country's going to the dogs.'
When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then spat out, 'And why have
you been expelled?'
'Because I did magic.'
'AHA!' roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on top of the fridge, which sprang
open; several of Dudley's lowfat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor. 'So you admit
it! What did you do to Dudley?'
'Nothing,' said Harry, slightly less calmly. 'That wasn't me ' 
'Was,' muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly
made flapping gestures at Harry to quieten him while they both bent low over Dudley.
'Go on, son,' said Uncle Vernon, 'what did he do?'
Tell us, darling,' whispered Aunt Petunia.
'Pointed his wand at me,' Dudley mumbled.
'Yeah, I did, but I didn't use ' Harry began angrily, but 
'SHUT UP!' roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison.
'Go on, son,' repeated Uncle Vernon, moustache blowing about furiously.
'All went dark,' Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. 'Everything dark. And then I hheard…
things. Inside mmy head.'
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. If their least favourite
thing in the world was magic  closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than
they did on the hosepipe ban  people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten.
They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.
'What sort of things did you hear, Popkin?' breathed Aunt Petunia, very whitefaced and
with tears in her eyes.
But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and shook his large blond
head, and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of
the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst
moments of their life. What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced
to hear?
'How come you fell over, son?' said Uncle Vernon, in an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind
of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person.
'Ttripped,' said Dudley shakily. 'And then 
He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood. Dudley was remembering the
clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.
'Horrible,' croaked Dudley. 'Cold. Really cold.'
'OK,' said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious
hand on Dudley's forehead to feel his temperature. 'What happened then, Dudders?'
'Felt… felt… felt… as if… as if…' 
'As if you'd never be happy again,' Harry supplied dully.
'Yes,' Dudley whispered, still trembling.
'So!' said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened
up. 'You put some crackpot spell on my son so he'd hear voices and believe he was  was
doomed to misery, or something, did you?'
'How many times do I have to tell you?' said Harry, temper and voice both rising. 'It
wasn't me! It was a couple of Dementors!'
'A couple of  what's this codswallop?'
'De  men  tors,' said Harry slowly and clearly. 'Two of them.'
'And what the ruddy hell are Dementors?'
'They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,' said Aunt Petunia.
Two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before Aunt Petunia clapped her
hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon
was goggling at her. Harrys brain reeled. Mrs Figg was one thing  but Aunt Petunia'?
'How d'you know that?' he asked her, astonished.
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful
apology, then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth.
'I heard  that awful boy  telling her about them  years ago,' she said jerkily.
'If you mean my mum and dad, why don't you use their names?' said Harry loudly, but
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered.
Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the course of which Aunt
Petunia had screamed that Harry's mother had been a freak, he had. never heard her
mention her sister. He was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information
about the magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into pretending
it didn't exist.
Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once more, shut it, then,
apparently struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a third time and croaked, 'So
 so  they  er  they  er  they actually exist, do they  er  Dementywhatsits?'
Aunt Petunia nodded. 
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was
going to shout 'April Fool!' When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was
spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening. It
zoomed through the stillopen window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a
clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry
tore a second officiallooking envelope from the owls beak and ripped it open as the owl
swooped back out into the night.
'Enough  effing  owls,' muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the
window and slamming it shut again.
Dear Mr Potter,
Further to our letter of approximately twentytwo minutes ago, the
Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may
retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of August, at which time
an official decision will be taken.
Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School o/ Witchcraft and
Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be
decided at that time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from school
pending further enquiries.
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
Mafalda Hopkirk

Ministry of Magic
Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The miserable knot in his
chest loosened slightly with the relief of Knowing he was not yet definitely expelled,
though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing
on the twelfth of August.
'Well?' said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings. 'What now? Have they
sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have the death penalty?' he added as a hopeful
afterthought.
'I've got to go to a hearing,' said Harry.
'And they'll sentence you there?' 
'I suppose so.'
'I won't give up hope, then,' said Uncle Vernon nastily.
'Well, if that's all,' said Harry, getting to his feet. He was desperate to be alone, to think,
perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione or Sirius.
'NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!' bellowed Uncle Vernon. 'SIT BACK DOWN!'
'What now?' said Harry impatiently.
'DUDLEY!' roared Uncle Vernon. 'I want to know exactly what happened to my son!'
'FINE!' yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his
wand, still clutched in his hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified.
'Dudley and w were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,' said
Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his temper. 'Dudley thought he'd be smart with
me, I pulled out my wand but didn't use it. Then two Dementors turned up '
'But what ARE Dementoids?' asked Uncle Vernon furiously. 'What do they DO?'
'I told you  they suck all the happiness out of you,' said Harry, 'and if they get the
chance, they kiss you 
'Kiss you?' said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. 'Kiss you?'
'It's what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.'
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.
'His soul? They didn't take  he's still got his '
She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though testing to see whether she
could hear his soul rattling around inside him.
'Of course they didn't get his soul, you'd know if they had,' said Harry, exasperated.
'Fought 'em off, did you, son?' said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the appearance of a man
struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood. 'Gave 'em the old
onetwo, did you?'
'You can't give a Dementor the old onetwo,' said Harry through clenched teeth.
'Why's he all right, then?' blustered Uncle Vernon. 'Why isn't he all empty, then?' 
'Because I used the Patronus '
WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl
came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.
'FOR GOD'S SAKE!' roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his
moustache, something he hadn't been driven to do in a long time. 'I WILL NOT HAVE
OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!'
But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl's leg. He was so
convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything  the
Dementors, Mrs Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort
everything out  that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius's
handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon's ongoing rant about owls, and narrowing his eyes
against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl look off back up the chimney,
Harry read Sirius's message.
Arthur has just told us what's happened. Don't leave the house again, whatever you do.
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight
that he turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was
nothing else.
And now his temper was rising again. Wasn't anybody going to say 'well done' for
fighting off two Dementors singlehanded? Both Mr Weasley and Sirius were acting as
though he'd misbehaved, and were saving their tellingsoff until they could ascertain how
much damage had been done.
'… a peck, w mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house. I won't have it, boy, w
won't '
'I can't stop the owls coming,' Harry snapped, crushing Sirius's letter in his fist.
I want the truth about what happened tonight!' barked Uncle Yirnon. 'If it was
Demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you've been expelled? You did youknowwhat,
you've admitted it!'
Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to ache again. He wanted
more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys.
'I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the Dementors,' he said, forcing himself to remain
calm. 'It's the only thing that works against them.'
'But what were Dementoids doing in Little Whinging?' said Uncle Vernon in an outraged
tone. 
'Couldn't tell you,' said Harry wearily. 'No idea.'
His head was pounding in the glare of the striplighting now. His anger was ebbing away.
He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at him.
'It's you,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 'It's got something to do with you, boy, I know it.
Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You've
got to be the only  the only ' Evidently, he couldn't bring himself to say the word
'wizard'. The only youknowwhat for miles.'
'I don't know why they were here.'
But at Uncle Vernon's words, Harry's exhausted brain had ground back into action. Why
had the Dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had
arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of
Magic lost control of the Dementors? Had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort,
as Dumbledore had predicted they would?
These Demembers guard some weirdo prison?' asked Uncle Vernon, lumbering along in
the wake of Harry's train of thought.
'Yes,' said Harry.
If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his
dark bedroom and think…
'Oho! They were coming to arrest you!' said Uncle Vernon, with the triumphant air of a
man reaching an unassailable conclusion. That's it, isn't it, boy? You're on the run from
the law!'
'Of course I'm not,' said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind
racing now.
Then why ?'
'He must have sent them,' said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon.
'What's that? Who must have sent them?'
'Lord Voldemort,' said Harry.
He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced and
squawked if they heard words like 'wizard', 'magic' or 'wand', could hear the name of the
most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor. 
'Lord  hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning
comprehension coming into his piggy eyes. 'I've heard that name… that was the one who
'
'Murdered my parents, yes,' Harry said dully.
'But he's gone,' said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder
of Harry's parents might be a painful topic. That giant bloke said so. He's gone.'
'He's back,' said Harry heavily.
It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia's surgically clean kitchen, beside
the topoftherange fridge and the widescreen television, talking calmly of Lord
Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. The arrival of the Dementors in Little Whinging seemed to
have breached the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly nonmagical world of
Privet Drive and the world beyond, Harry's two lives had somehow become fused and
everything had been turned upsidedown; the Dursleys were asking for details about the
magical world, and Mrs Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; Dementors were soaring around
Little Whinging, and he might never return to Hogwarts. Harry's head throbbed more
painfully.
'Back?' whispered Aunt Petunia.
She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. And all of a sudden, for
the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother's
sister. He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he
knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord
Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like
that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sister's) were not narrowed in dislike or
anger, they were wide and fearful. The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained
all Harry's life  that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited
with Uncle Vernon  seemed to have fallen away.
'Yes,' Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. 'He came back a month ago. I saw
him.'
Her hands found Dudley's massive leatherclad shoulders and clutched them.
'Hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently
dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up
between them. 'Hang on. This Lord Voldything's back, you say.'
'Yes.'
The one who murdered your parents.' 
'Yes.'
'And now he's sending Dismembers after you?'
'Looks like it,' said Harry.
'I see,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his whitefaced wife to Harry and hitching up his
trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching before Harry's eyes.
'Well, that settles it,' he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, 'you can get
out of this house, boy!'
'What?' said Harry.
'You heard me  OUT!' Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley
jumped. 'OUT! OUT! I should've done this years ago! Owls treating the place like a rest
home, puddings exploding, half the lounge destroyed, Dudley's tail, Marge bobbing
around on the ceiling and that flying Ford Anglia  OUT! OUT! You've had it! You're
history! You're not staying here if some loony's after you, you're not endangering my
wife and son, you're not bringing trouble down on us. If you're going the same way as
your useless parents, I've had it! OUT!'
Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, Mr Weasley and Sirius were
all crushed in his left hand. Don't leave the house again, whatever you do. DO NOT
LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE.
'You heard me!' said Uncle Vernon, bending forwards now, his massive purple face
coming so close to Harry's, he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face. 'Get going! You
were all keen to leave half an hour ago! I'm right behind you! Get out and never darken
our doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place, I don't know, Marge was
right, it should have been the orphanage. We were too damn soft for our own good,
thought we could squash it out of you, thought we could turn you normal, but you've
been rotten from the beginning and I've had enough  owls!'
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming
into the air again with a loud screech. Harry raised his hand to seize the letter, which was
in a scarlet envelope, but it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia,
who let out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the red
envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight back up the chimney.
Harry darted forwards to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat him to it.
'You can open it if you like,' said Harry, 'but I'll hear what it says anyway. That's a
Howler.'
'Let go of it, Petunia!' roared Uncle Vernon. 'Don't touch it, it could be dangerous!' 
'It's addressed to me,' said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. 'It's addressed to me, Vernon,
look! Mrs Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet Drive 
She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to smoke.
'Open it!' Harry urged her. 'Get it over with! It'll happen anyway.'
'No.'
Aunt Petunia's hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the kitchen as though
looking for an escape route, but too late the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia
screamed and dropped it.
An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning
letter on the table.
'Remember my last, Petunia.'
Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the chair beside Dudley, her
face in her hands. The remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence.
'What is this?' Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. 'What  I don't Petunia?'
Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his mother, his mouth hanging
open. The silence spiralled horribly. Harry was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his
head throbbing fit to burst.
'Petunia, dear?' said Uncle Vernon timidly. 'PPetunia?'
She raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.
'The boy  the boy will have to stay, Vernon,' she said weakly.
'Wwhat?'
'He stays,' she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her feet again.
'He… but Petunia…'
'If we throw him out, the neighbours will talk,' she said. She was rapidly regaining her
usual brisk, snappish manner, though she was still very pale. They'll ask awkward
questions, they'll want to know where he's gone. We'll have to keep him.'
Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tyre.
'But Petunia, dear  
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry. 'You're to stay in your room,' she said.
'You're not to leave the house. Now get to bed.' Harry didn't move. 'Who was that Howler
from?'
'Don't ask questions,' Aunt Petunia snapped. 'Are you in touch with wizards?'
'I told you to get to bed!'
'What did it mean? Remember the last what?'
'Go to bed!'
'How come ?'
'YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GO UP TO BED!'
 CHAPTER THREE 
The Advance Guard
I've just been attacked by Dementors and I might be expelled from llogwarts. I want to
know what's going on and when I'm going to get out of here.
Harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he
reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron
and the third to Hermione. His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on
the desk. Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his
brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness. His back
ached from hauling Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head where the window and
Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully.
Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his teeth and
clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, starstrewn sky every time he
passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs Figg and Mundungus Fletcher
tailing him in secret, then suspension fromHogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of
Magic  and still no one was telling him what was going on.
And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had echoed so horribly, so
menacingly, through the kitchen?
Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was everyone treating him like
some naughty kid? Don't do any more magic, stay in the house…
He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse,
as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his
body. 
Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings
like a small ghost.
'About time!' Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage. 'You can put that
down, I've got work for you!'
Hedwig's large, round, amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog
clamped in her beak.
'Come here,' said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong
and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. Take these straight to Sirius, Ron and Hermione and
don't come back here without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they've written
decentlength answers if you've got to. Understand?'
Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, her beak still full of frog.
'Get going, then,' said Harry.
She took off immediately. The moment she'd gone, Harry threw himself down on his bed
without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition to every other miserable
feeling, he now felt guilty that he'd been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he
had at number four, Privet Drive. But he'd make it up to her when she came back with the
answers from Sirius, Ron and Hermione.
They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn't possibly ignore a Dementor attack.
He'd probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his
immediate removal to The Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him,
stifling all further thought.
*
But Hedwig didn't return next morning. Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it
only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room
through the catflap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry
heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well
have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise, the Dursleys kept
well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn't see the point of forcing his company on them;
another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry he'd perform more
illegal magic.
So it went on for three whole days. Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that
made him unable to settle to anything, during which time he paced his bedroom, furious
at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess; and with a lethargy so
complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space,
aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing. 
What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in
half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not return to living fulltime with
the Dursleys, not now he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged.
Might he be able to move into Siriuss house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before
he had been forced to flee from the Ministry? Would Harry be allowed to live there
alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be
decided for him? Had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe
enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry
invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after Hedwig's departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic
phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his uncle entered his
bedroom. Harry looked slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit
and an expression of enormous smugness.
'We're going out,' he said.
'Sorry?'
'We  that is to say, your aunt, Dudley and I  are going out.'
'Fine,' said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
'You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.'
'OK.'
'You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.'
'Right.'
'You are not to steal food from the fridge.'
'OK.'
'I am going to lock your door.'
'You do that.'
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped
out of the room and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and
Uncle Vernon's footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard
the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakeable sound of the
car sweeping out of the drive. 
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to him
whether they were in the house or not. He could not even summon the energy to get up
and turn on his bedroom light. The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay
listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for
the blessed moment when Hedwig returned. The empty house creaked around him. The
pipes gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in
misery.
Then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below. He sat bolt upright, listening
intently. The Dursleys couldn't be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn't
heard their car.
There was silence for a few seconds, then voices. Burglars, he thought, sliding off the
bed on to his feet  but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep
their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not
troubling to do so.
He snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door,
listening with all his might. Next moment, he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and
his door swung open. Harry stood motionless, staring through the open doorway at the
dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated
for a moment, then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs.
His heart shot upwards into his throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall
below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of
them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him.
'Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone's eye out,' said a low, growling voice.
Harry's heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he did not lower his
wand.
'Professor Moody?' he said uncertainly.
'I don't know so much about "Professor",' growled the voice, 'never got round to much
teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.'
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor did he move. He had
very good reason to be suspicious. He had recently spent nine months in what he had
thought was MadEye Moody's company only to find out that it wasn't Moody at all, but
an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked.
But before he could make a decision about what to do next, a second, slightly hoarse
voice floated upstairs.
'It's all right, Harry. We've come to take you away.' 
Harry's heart leapt. He knew that voice, too, though he hadn't heard it for over a year.
'PProfessor Lupin?' he said disbelievingly. 'Is that you?'
'Why are we all standing in the dark?' said a third voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a
woman's. 'Lumos.'
A wandtip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry blinked. The people
below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing up at him intently, some craning
their heads for a better look.
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and
rather ill; he had more grey hairs than when Harry had last said goodbye to him and his
robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at
Harry, who tried to smile back despite his state of shock.
'Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,' said the witch who was holding her lit wand
aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had a pale heartshaped face, dark twinkling
eyes, and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet. 'Wotcher, Harry!'
'Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,' said a bald black wizard standing furthest back  he
had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear  'he looks exactly like
James.'
'Except the eyes,' said a wheezyvoiced, silverhaired wizard at the back. 'Lily's eyes.'
MadEye Moody, who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his
nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes. One eye was
small, dark and beady, the other large, round and electric blue  the magical eye that
could see through walls, doors and the back of Moody's own head. 'Are you quite sure it's
him, Lupin?' he growled. 'It'd be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater
impersonating him. We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know.
Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum?'
'Harry, what form does your Patronus take?' Lupin asked. 'A stag,' said Harry nervously.
That's him, MadEye,' said Lupin.
Very conscious of everybody still staring at him, Harry descended the stairs, stowing his
wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
'Don't put your wand there, boy!' roared Moody. 'What if it ignited? Better wizards than
you have lost buttocks, you know!'
'Who d'you know who's lost a buttock?' the violethaired woman asked MadEye
interestedly. 
'Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!' growled MadEye.
'Elementary wandsafety, nobody bothers about it any more.' He stumped off towards the
kitchen. 'And I saw that,' he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes towards the
ceiling.
Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry's. 'How are you?' he asked, looking closely at
Harry. Tfine…'
Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a
plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was
standing matteroffactly in the house as though this was a longstanding arrangement.
He glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him. He felt
very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days.
'I'm  you're really lucky the Dursleys are out…' he mumbled.
'Lucky, ha!' said the violethaired woman. 'It was me who lured them out of the way. Sent
a letter by Muggle post telling them they'd been shortlisted for the AllEngland Best
Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. They're heading off to the prizegiving right now… or
they think they are.'
Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon's face when he realised there was no AllEngland Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
'We are leaving, aren't we?' he asked. 'Soon?'
Almost at once,' said Lupin, 'we're just waiting for the allclear.'
'Where are we going? The Burrow?' Harry asked hopefully.
'Not The Burrow, no,' said Lupin, motioning Harry towards the kitchen; the little knot of
wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. Too risky. We've set up Headquarters
somewhere undetectable. It's taken a while…'
MadEye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask, his
magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in the Dursleys' many laboursaving
appliances.
'This is Alastor Moody, Harry' Lupin continued, pointing towards Moody.
'Yeah, I know,' said Harry uncomfortably. It felt odd to be introduced to somebody he'd
thought he'd known for a year.
'And this is Nymphadora '
'Don't call me Nymphadora, Remus,' said the young witch with a shudder, 'it's Tonks.' 
'Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only,' finished Lupin.
'So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora,' muttered Tonks.
'And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt.' He indicated the tall black wizard, who bowed.
'Elphias Doge.' The wheezyvoiced wizard nodded. 'Dedalus Diggle '
'We've met before,' squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his violetcoloured top hat.
'Emmeline Vance.' A statelylooking witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her head.
'Sturgis Podmore.' A squarejawed wizard with thick strawcoloured hair winked. 'And
Hestia Jones.' A pinkcheeked, blackhaired witch waved from next to the toaster.
Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced. He wished
they would look at something other than him; it was as though he had suddenly been
ushered onstage. He also wondered why so many of them were there.
'A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,' said Lupin, as though
he had read Harry's mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly.
'Yeah, well, the more the better,' said Moody darkly. 'We're your guard, Potter.'
'We're just waiting for the signal to tell us it's safe to set off,' said Lupin, glancing out of
the kitchen window. 'We've got about fifteen minutes.'
'Very clean, aren't they, these Muggles?' said the witch called Tonks, who was looking
around the kitchen with great interest. 'My dad's Muggleborn and he's a right old slob. I
suppose it varies, just as it does with wizards?'
'Er  yeah,' said Harry. 'Look ' he turned back to Lupin, 'what's going on, I haven't heard
anything from anyone, what's Vol?'
Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his
hat again and Moody growled, 'Shut up!'
What?' said Harry.
'We're not discussing anything here, it's too risky,' said Moody, turning his normal eye on
Harry. His magical eye remained focused on the ceiling. 'Damn it,' he added angrily,
putting a hand up to the magical eye, 'it keeps getting stuck  ever since that scum wore
it.'
And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he
popped out his eye.
'MadEye, you do know that's disgusting, don't you?' said Tonks conversationally. 
'Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry,' requested Moody.
Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink,
still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless staring was starting to
annoy him.
'Cheers,' said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He dropped the magical eyeball
into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in
turn. 'I want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.'
'How're we getting  wherever we're going?' Harry asked.
'Brooms,' said Lupin. 'Only way. You're too young to Apparate, they'll be watching the
Floo Network and it's more than our life's worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey.'
'Remus says you're a good flier,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice.
'He's excellent,' said Lupin, who was checking his watch. 'Anyway, you'd better go and
get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes.'
'I'll come and help you,' said Tonks brightly.
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much
curiosity and interest.
'Funny place,' she said. 'It's a bit too clean, d'you know what w mean? Bit unnatural. Oh,
this is better,' she added, as they entered Harry's bedroom and he turned on the light.
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined to it for four
days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the
books he owned were strewn over the floor where he'd tried to distract himself with each
in turn and thrown it aside; Hedwig's cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell;
and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizards' robes
that had spilled on to the floor around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at
his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the
door.
'You know, I don't think violet's really my colour,' she said pensivey, tugging at a lock of
spiky hair. 'D'you think it makes me look a bit peaky?'
'Er ' said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and
Ireland. 
'Yeah, it does,' said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as
though she was struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned
bubblegum pink.
'How did you do that?' said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her eyes again.
'I'm a Metamorphmagus,' she said, looking back at her reflection and turning her head so
that she could see her hair from all directions. 'It means I can change my appearance at
will,' she added, spotting Harrys puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. 'I was born
one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any
study at all, it was great.'
'You're an Auror?' said Harry, impressed. Being a Darkwizardcatcher was the only
career he'd ever considered after Hogwarts.
'Yeah,' said Tonks, looking proud. 'Kingsley is as well, he's a bit higher up than me,
though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking. I'm dead
clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs?'
'Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?' Harry asked her, straightening up,
completely forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
'Bet you wouldn't mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?'
Her eyes found the lightningshaped scar on Harrys forehead.
'No, I wouldn't mind,' Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not like people staring at his
scar.
'Well, you'll have to learn the hard way, I'm afraid,' said Tonks. 'Metamorphmagi are
really rare, they're born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand, or potions, to
change their appearance. But we've got to get going, Harry, we're supposed to be
packing,' she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.
'Oh  yeah,' said Harry, grabbing a few more books.
'Don't be stupid, it'll be much quicker if I  pack!' cried Tonks, waving her wand in a
long, sweeping movement over the floor.
Books, clothes, telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew pellmell into the
trunk.
'It's not very neat,' said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble
inside. 'My mums got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly  she even gets the 
socks to fold themselves  but I've never mastered how she does it  it's a kind of flick '
She flicked her wand hopefully.
One of Harry's socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in
the trunk.
'Ah, well,' said Tonks, slamming the trunk's lid shut, 'at least it's all in. That could do with
a bit of cleaning, too.' She pointed her wand at Hedwig's cage. 'Scourgify.' A few feathers
and droppings vanished. 'Well, that's a bit better  I've never quite got the hang of these
householdy sort of spells. Right  got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow!  A
FireboltT
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry's right hand It was his pride and
joy, a gift from Sirius, an internationalstandard broomstick.
'And I'm still riding a Comet Two Sixty' said Tonks enviously. 'Ah well… wand still in
your jeans? Both buttocks still on? OK, let's go. Locomotor trunk.'
Harry's trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a conductor's baton,
Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig's
cage in her left hand. Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick.
Back in the kitchen Moody had replaced his eye, which was spinning so fast after its
cleaning it made Harry feel sick to look at it. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore
were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had
come across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the
Dursleys.
'Excellent,' said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. We've got about a minute,
I think. We should probably get out into the garden so we're ready. Harry, I've left a letter
telling your aunt and uncle not to worry 
They won't,' said Harry.
 that you're safe 'That'll just depress them.'
 and you'll see them next summer.'
'Do I have to?'
Lupin smiled but made no answer.
'Come here, boy,' said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry towards him with his wand. 'I
need to Disillusion you.'
'You need to what?' said Harry nervously. 
'Disillusionment Charm,' said Moody, raising his wand. 'Lupin says you've got an
Invisibility Cloak, but it won't stay on while we're flying; this'll disguise you better. Here
you go 
He rapped him hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though
Moody had just smashed an egg there;
cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck.
'Nice one, MadEye,' said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry's midriff.
Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn't look
anything like his any more. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact colour
and texture of the kitchen unit behind him. He seemed to have become a human
chameleon.
'Come on,' said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.
They all stepped outside on to Uncle Vernon's beautifully kept lawn.
'Clear night,' grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens. 'Could've done with
a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,' he barked at Harry, 'we're going to be flying in close
formation. Tonks'll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin'll be covering
you from below I'm going to be behind you. The rest'll be circling us. We don't break
ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed 
'Is that likely?' Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him.
 the others keep flying, don't stop, don't break ranks. If they take out all of us and you
survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and they'll
join you.'
'Stop being so cheerful, MadEye, he'll think we're not taking this seriously' said Tonks,
as she strapped Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage into a harness hanging from her broom.
'I'm just telling the boy the plan,' growled Moody. 'Our jobs to deliver him safely to
Headquarters and if we die in the attempt 
'No one's going to die,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice.
'Mount your brooms, that's the first signal!' said Lupin sharply pointing into the sky.
Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars, Harry
recognised them at once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped
its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to
be up in the air once more. 
'Second signal, let's go!' said Lupin loudly as more sparks, green this time, exploded high
above them.
Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through his hair as the
neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark
greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as
though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though his heart was going
to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he'd been
fantasising about all summer, he was going home… for a few glorious moments, all his
problems seemed to recede to nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.
'Hard left, hard left, there's a Muggle looking up!' shouted Moody from behind him.
Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her
broom. 'We need more height… give it another quarter of a mile!'
Harry's eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards; he could see nothing below now
but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny
lights might belong to Uncle Vernon's car… the Dursleys would be heading back to their
empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent Lawn Competition… and
Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes
of the others, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, and the whoosh
of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month,
or this happy.
'Bearing south!' shouted MadEye. Town ahead!'
They soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spider's web of lights
below.
'Bear southeast and keep climbing, there's some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves
in!' called Moody.
'We're not going through clouds!' shouted Tonks angrily, 'we'll get soaked, MadEye!'
Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing numb on the Firebolt's
handle. He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver.
They altered their course every now and then according to MadEyes instructions. Harrys
eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache;
he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch
match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard
around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time.
He wondered how long they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least.
Turning southwest!' yelled Moody 'We want to avoid the motorway!' 
Harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug, dry interiors of the cars
streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of travelling by Floo powder; it might
be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames…
Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the
moonlight… now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left
and right… then she, too, swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore…
'We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we're not being followed!' Moody
shouted.
'ARE YOU MAD, MADEYE?' Tonks screamed from the front. We're all frozen to our
brooms! If we keep going offcourse we're not going to get there until next week!
Besides, we're nearly there now!'
Time to start the descent!' came Lupin's voice. 'Follow Tonks, Harry!'
Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest collection of lights
he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids,
interspersed with patches of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could
see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys and television aerials. He wanted to
reach the ground very much, though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him
from his broom.
'Here we go!' called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the
middle of a small square. Tonks was already unbuckling Harry's trunk. Shivering, Harry
looked around. The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of
them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light fro the streetlamps, paint was
peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front
steps.
'Where are we?' Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, 'In a minute.'
Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with cold.
'Got it,' he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and
clicking it.
The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp
went out; he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only
remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.
'Borrowed it from Dumbledore,' growled Moody, pocketing the PutOuter. That'll take
care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now come on, quick.' 
He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, across the road and on to
the pavement; Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harry's trunk between them, the rest
of the guard, all with their wands out, flanking them.
The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest
house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging binbags just
inside the broken gate.
'Here,' Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment towards Harry's Disillusioned
hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the writing. 'Read quickly
and memorise.'
Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar.
It said:
The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve,
Grimmauld Place, London.
 CHAPTER FOUR 
Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place
ʹWhatʹs the Order of the ‐?ʹ Harry began.
ʹNot here, boy!ʹ snarled Moody. ʹWait till weʹre inside!ʹ 
He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harryʹs hand and set fire to it with his
wand‐tip. As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry
looked around at the houses again. They were standing outside number eleven;
he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number
thirteen.
ʹBut whereʹs ‐?ʹ 
Think about what youʹve just memorised,ʹ said Lupin quietly.
Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve,
Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between
numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy
windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either
side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on.
Apparently the Muggles inside hadnʹt felt anything.
ʹCome on, hurry,ʹ growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.
Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialised door. Its
black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver doorknocker was in the form of
a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or letterbox.
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard many loud,
metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain. The door creaked
open.
ʹGet in quick, Harry,ʹ Lupin whispered, ʹbut donʹt go far inside and donʹt touch
anything.ʹ 
Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall. He
could smell damp, dust and a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of
a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in
behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying his trunk and Hedwigʹs cage. Moody was
standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the Put‐Outer had stolen from
the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the front
door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.
ʹHere ‐ʹ 
He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as though
something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the
Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
ʹNow stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,ʹ Moody whispered.
The othersʹ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was
as though they had just entered the house of a dying person. He heard a soft
hissing noise and then old‐fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the
walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and
threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier
glimmered overhead and age‐blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls.
Harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board. Both the chandelier
and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
There were hurried footsteps and Rons mother, Mrs Weasley, emerged from a
door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in welcome as she hurried
towards them, though Harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than
she had been last time he had seen her.
ʹOh, Harry, itʹs lovely to see you!ʹ she whispered, pulling him into a rib‐cracking
hug before holding him at armʹs length and examining him critically. ʹYouʹre
looking peaky; you need feeding up, but youʹll have to wait a bit for dinner, Iʹm
afraid.ʹ 
She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, ʹHeʹs just
arrived, the meetingʹs started.ʹ 
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began
filing past him towards the door through which Mrs Weasley had just come.
Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs Weasley held him back.
ʹNo, Harry, the meetings only for members of the Order. Ron and Hermione are
upstairs, you can wait with them until the meetings over, then weʹll have dinner.
And keep your voice down in the hall,ʹ she added in an urgent whisper.
ʹWhy?ʹ 
ʹI donʹt want anything to wake up.ʹ 
ʹWhat dʹyou ‐?ʹ 
ʹIʹll explain later, Iʹve got to hurry, Iʹm supposed to be at the meeting ‐ Iʹll just
show you where youʹre sleeping.ʹ 
Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long, moth‐
eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and
after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made
from a severed trollʹs leg they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of
shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry
that the heads belonged to house‐elves. All of them had the same rather snout‐
like nose.
Harryʹs bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on earth were
they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the darkest of
wizards?
ʹMrs Weasley, why ‐?ʹ 
ʹRon and Hermione will explain everything, dear, Iʹve really got to dash,ʹ Mrs
Weasley whispered distractedly. There ‐ʹ they had reached the second landing, ʹ‐ 
youʹre the door on the right. Iʹll call you when itʹs over.ʹ 
And she hurried off downstairs again.
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was
shaped like a serpents head, and opened the door.
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high‐ceilinged, twin‐bedded room; then
there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his
vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair.
Hermione had thrown herself on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat,
while Ronʹs tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their
heads.
ʹHARRY! Ron, heʹs here, Harrys here! We didnʹt hear you arrive! Oh, how are
you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know
our letters were useless ‐ but we couldnʹt tell you anything, Dumbledore made us
swear we wouldnʹt, oh, weʹve got so much to tell you, and youʹve got things to
tell us ‐ the Dementors! When we heard ‐ and that Ministry hearing ‐ itʹs just
outrageous, Iʹve looked it all up, they canʹt expel you, they just canʹt, thereʹs
provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for
the use of magic in life‐threatening situations ‐ʹ 
ʹLet him breathe, Hermione,ʹ said Ron, grinning as he closed the door behind
Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart,
making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, though the long nose,
bright red hair and freckles were the same.
Still beaming, Hermione let go of Harry, but before she could say another word
there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a
dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harrys shoulder.
ʹHedwig!ʹ 
The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as Harry
stroked her feathers.
ʹSheʹs been in a right state,ʹ said Ron. ʹPecked us half to death when she brought
your last letters, look at this ‐ʹ 
He showed Harry the index finger ol his right hand, which sported a half‐healed
but clearly deep cut.
ʹOh, yeah,ʹ Harry said. ʹSorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know ‐ʹ 
ʹWe wanted to give them to you, mate,ʹ said Ron. ʹHermione was going spare,
she kept saying youʹd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own
without news, but Dumbledore made us ‐ʹ 
ʹ‐ swear not to tell me,ʹ said Harry. ʹYeah, Hermioneʹs already said. ʹ 
The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was
extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach. All of a sudden ‐ 
after yearning to see them for a solid month  he felt he would rather Ron and
Hermione left him alone.
There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not
looking at either of the others.
ʹHe seemed to think it was best,ʹ said Hermione rather breathlessly.
ʹDumbledore, I mean.ʹ 
ʹRight,ʹ said Harry. He noticed that her hands, too, bore the marks of Hedwigs
beak and found that he was not at all sorry.
ʹI think he thought you were safest with the Muggles ‐ʹ Ron began.
ʹYeah?ʹ said Harry, raising his eyebrows. ʹHave either of you been attacked by
Dementors this summer?ʹ 
ʹWell, no ‐ but thatʹs why heʹs had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing
you all the time ‐ʹ 
Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going
downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed, except him.
ʹDidnʹt work that well, though, did it?ʹ said Harry, doing his utmost to keep his
voice even. ʹHad to look after myself after all, didnʹt I?ʹ 
ʹHe was so angry,ʹ said Hermione, in an almost awestruck voice. ʹDumbledore.
We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended.
He was scary.ʹ 
ʹWell, Iʹm glad he left,ʹ Harry said coldly. ʹIf he hadnʹt, I wouldnʹt have done
magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.ʹ 
ʹArenʹt you… arenʹt you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?ʹ said
Hermione quietly.
ʹNo,ʹ Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking around, with
Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise
his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture
frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls, and as Harry passed
it he thought he heard someone, who was lurking out of sight, snigger.
ʹSo whyʹs Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?ʹ 
Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. ʹDid you ‐ er ‐ bother to
ask him at all?ʹ 
He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was
behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing to improve his temper.
ʹWe told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,ʹ said Ron. ʹWe
did, mate. But heʹs really busy now, weʹve only seen him twice since we came
here and he didnʹt have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you
important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted.ʹ 
ʹHe could stillʹve kept me informed if heʹd wanted to,ʹ Harry said shortly. ʹYouʹre
not telling me he doesnʹt know ways to send messages without owls.ʹ 
Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, ʹI thought that, too. But he didnʹt want
you to know anything.ʹ 
ʹMaybe he thinks w canʹt be trusted,ʹ said Harry, watching their expressions.
ʹDonʹt be thick,ʹ said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.
ʹOr that I canʹt take care of myself.ʹ 
ʹOf course he doesnʹt think that!ʹ said Hermione anxiously.
ʹSo how come I have to stay at the Dursleysʹ while you two get to join in
everything thatʹs going on here?ʹ said Harry, the words tumbling over one
another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every word. ʹHow come you
two are allowed to know everything thatʹs going on?ʹ 
ʹWeʹre not!ʹ Ron interrupted. ʹMum wonʹt let us near the meetings, she says weʹre
too young ‐ʹ 
But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.
ʹSO YOU HAVENʹT BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOUʹVE STILL
BEEN HERE, HAVENʹT YOU? YOUʹVE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, IʹVE
BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYSʹ FOR A MONTH! AND IʹVE HANDLED
MORE THAN YOU TWOʹVE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS
IT ‐WHO SAVED THE PHILOSOPHERʹS STONE? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE?
WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?ʹ 
Every bitter and resentful thought Harry had had in the past month was pouring
out of him: his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been
together without him, his fury at being followed and not told about it ‐ all the
feelings he was half‐ashamed of finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took
fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon
twittered in alarm and zoomed even taster around their heads.
ʹWHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER
FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO
ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!ʹ 
Ron was standing there with his mouth half‐open, clearly stunned and at a loss
for anything to say, whilst Hermione looked on the verge of tears.
ʹBUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHATʹS GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE
BOTHER TO TELL ME WHATʹS BEEN HAPPENING?ʹ 
ʹHarry, we wanted to tell you, we really did ‐ʹ Hermione began.
ʹCANTʹVE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOUʹD HAVE SENT
ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR ‐
Well, he did ‐ʹ 
ʹFOUR WEEKS IʹVE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT
OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHATʹS BEEN GOING ON ‐ʹ 
We wanted to ‐ʹ 
ʹI SUPPOSE YOUʹVE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVENʹT YOU, ALL
HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER ‐ʹ 
ʹNo, honest ‐ʹ 
ʹHarry weʹre really sorry!ʹ said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling
with tears. ʹYouʹre absolutely right, Harry ‐ Iʹd be furious if it was me!ʹ 
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again,
pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe.
There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards
below Harryʹs feet.
ʹWhat is this place, anyway?ʹ he shot at Ron and Hermione.
ʹHeadquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,ʹ said Ron at once.
ʹIs anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix ‐?ʹ 
ʹItʹs a secret society,ʹ said Hermione quickly. ʹDumbledoreʹs in charge, he
founded it. Itʹs the people who fought against You‐Know‐Who last time.ʹ 
ʹWhoʹs in it?ʹ said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets.
ʹQuite a few people ‐ʹ 
ʹWeʹve met about twenty of them,ʹ said Ron, ʹbut we think there are more.ʹ 
Harry glared at them.
ʹWell?ʹ he demanded, looking from one to the other.
ʹEr,ʹ said Ron. ʹWell what?ʹ 
ʹVoldemort!ʹ said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione winced. ʹWhatʹs
happening? Whatʹs he up to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him?ʹ 
ʹWeʹve told you, the Order donʹt let us in on their meetings,ʹ said Hermione
nervously. ʹSo we donʹt know the details ‐ but weʹve got a general idea,ʹ she
added hastily, seeing the look on Harryʹs face.
ʹFred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,ʹ said Ron. Theyʹre really
useful.ʹ 
ʹExtendable ‐?ʹ 
ʹEars, yeah. Only weʹve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out
and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning
them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realised what was
going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters,
keeping tabs on them, you know ‐ʹ 
ʹSome of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order ‐ʹ said
Hermione.
ʹAnd some of them are standing guard over something,ʹ said Ron. Theyʹre always
talking about guard duty.ʹ 
ʹCouldnʹt have been me, could it?ʹ said Harry sarcastically.
ʹOh, yeah,ʹ said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.
Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron
and Hermione. ʹSo, what have you two been doing, if youʹre not allowed in
meetings?ʹ he demanded. ʹYou said youʹd been busy.ʹ 
ʹWe have,ʹ said Hermione quickly. ʹWeʹve been decontaminating this house, itʹs
been empty for ages and stuffʹs been breeding in here. Weʹve managed to clean
out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms and I think weʹre doing the drawing room
tomo‐ʹ 
With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ronʹs elder twin brothers, had
materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered
more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the wardrobe.
ʹStop doing that!ʹ Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red‐
haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.
ʹHello, Harry,ʹ said George, beaming at him. ʹWe thought we heard your dulcet
tones.ʹ 
ʹYou donʹt want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,ʹ said Fred,
also beaming. There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didnʹt
hear you.ʹ 
ʹYou two passed your Apparation tests, then?ʹ asked Harry grumpily.
ʹWith distinction,ʹ said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very
long, flesh‐coloured string.
ʹIt would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,ʹ 
said Ron.
Time is Galleons, little brother,ʹ said Fred. ʹAnyway, Harry, youʹre interfering
with reception. Extendable Ears,ʹ he added in response to Harryʹs raised
eyebrows, and held up the string which Harry now saw was trailing out on to
the landing. Weʹre trying to hear whatʹs going on downstairs.ʹ 
ʹYou want to be careful,ʹ said Ron, staring at the Ear, ʹif Mum sees one of them
again…ʺ 
ʹItʹs worth the risk, thatʹs a major meeting theyʹre having,ʹ said Fred.
The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.
ʹOh, hello, Harry!ʹ said Ronʹs younger sister, Ginny, brightly. ʹI thought I heard
your voice.ʹ 
Turning to Fred and George, she said, ʹItʹs no‐go with the Extendable Ears, sheʹs
gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.ʹ 
ʹHow dʹyou know?ʹ said George, looking crestfallen.
Tonks told me how to find out,ʹ said Ginny. ʹYou just chuck stuff at the door and
if it canʹt make contact the doorʹs been Imperturbed. Iʹve been flicking
Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so
thereʹs no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.ʹ 
Fred heaved a deep sigh.
ʹShame. I really fancied finding out what old Snapeʹs been up to.ʹ 
ʹSnape!ʹ said Harry quickly. ʹIs he here?ʹ 
ʹYeah,ʹ said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the
beds; Fred and Ginny followed. ʹGiving a report. Top secret.ʹ 
ʹGit,ʹ said Fred idly.
ʹHeʹs on our side now,ʹ said Hermione reprovingly.
Ron snorted. ʹDoesnʹt stop him being a git. The way he looks at us when he sees
us.ʹ 
ʹBill doesnʹt like him, either,ʹ said Ginny, as though that settled the matter.
Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was
now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank on to the bed opposite the
others.
ʹIs Bill here?ʹ he asked. ʹI thought he was working in Egypt?ʹ 
ʹHe applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,ʹ said
Fred. ʹHe says he misses the tombs, but; he smirked, ʹthere are compensations.ʹ 
ʹWhat dʹyou mean?ʹ 
ʹRemember old Fleur Delacour?ʹ said George. ʹSheʹs got a job at Gringotts to
eempwve ʹer Eeenglish ‐ʹ 
ʹAnd Billʹs been giving her a lot of private lessons,ʹ sniggered Fred.
ʹCharlieʹs in the Order, too,ʹ said George, ʹbut heʹs still in Romania. Dumbledore
wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlieʹs trying to
make contacts on his days off.ʹ 
ʹCouldnʹt Percy do that?ʹ Harry asked. The last he had heard, the third Weasley
brother was working in the Department of International Magical Co‐operation at
the Ministry of Magic.
At Harryʹs words, all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant
looks.
ʹWhatever you do, donʹt mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,ʹ Ron told
Harry in a tense voice.
ʹWhy not?ʹ 
ʹBecause every time Percyʹs nameʹs mentioned, Dad breaks whatever heʹs
holding and Mum starts crying,ʹ Fred said.
ʹItʹs been awful,ʹ said Ginny sadly.
ʹI think weʹre well shot of him,ʹ said George, with an uncharacteristically ugly
look on his face.
ʹWhatʹs happened?ʹ Harry said.
ʹPercy and Dad had a row,ʹ said Fred. ʹIʹve never seen Dad row with anyone like
that. Itʹs normally Mum who shouts.ʹ 
ʹIt was the first week back after term ended,ʹ said Ron. ʹWe were about to come
and join the Order. Percy came home and told us heʹd been promoted.ʹ 
ʹYouʹre kidding?ʹ said Harry.
Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harryʹs
impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his first job at the
Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to
notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the
Ministry had believed it ‐ they all thought Mr Crouch had gone mad).
ʹYeah, we were all surprised,ʹ said George, ʹbecause Percy got into a load of
trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy
ought to have realised Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior. But
you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasnʹt going to complain.ʹ 
ʹSo how come they promoted him?ʹ 
Thatʹs exactly what we wondered,ʹ said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep
normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. ʹHe came home
really pleased with himself ‐ even more pleased than usual, if you can imagine
that ‐ and told Dad heʹd been offered a position in Fudgeʹs own office. A really
good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts: Junior Assistant to the
Minister. He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.ʹ 
ʹOnly Dad wasnʹt,ʹ said Fred grimly.
ʹWhy not?ʹ said Harry.
ʹWell, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that
nobodyʹs having any contact with Dumbledore,ʹ said George.
ʹDumbledoreʹs name is mud with the Ministry these days, see,ʹ said Fred. They
all think heʹs just making trouble saying You‐Know‐Whoʹs back.ʹ 
ʹDad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone whoʹs in league with Dumbledore
can clear out their desks,ʹ said George.
ʹTrouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows heʹs friendly with Dumbledore, and
heʹs always thought Dadʹs a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession.ʹ 
ʹBut whatʹs that got to do with Percy?ʹ asked Harry, contused.
ʹIʹm coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he
wants to use him to spy on the family ‐ and Dumbledore.ʹ 
Harry let out a low whistle.
ʹBet Percy loved that.ʹ 
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.
ʹHe went completely berserk. He said ‐ well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He
said heʹs been having to struggle against Dadʹs lousy reputation ever since he
joined the Ministry and that Dadʹs got no ambition and thatʹs why weʹve always
been ‐ you know ‐ not had a lot of money, I mean ‐ʹ 
ʹWhat?ʹ said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat.
ʹI know,ʹ said Ron in a low voice. ʹAnd it got worse. He said Dad was an idiot to
run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and
Dad was going to go down with him, and that he ‐ Percy ‐ knew where his
loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to
become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he
didnʹt belong to our family any more. And he packed his bags the same night
and left. Heʹs living here in London now.ʹ 
Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of Ronʹs brothers,
but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr Weasley.
ʹMumʹs been in a right state,ʹ said Ron dully. ʹYou know ‐ crying and stuff. She
came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I
dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work ‐ ignores him, Iʹsʹpose.ʹ 
ʹBut Percy must know Voldemortʹs back,ʹ said Harry slowly. ʹHeʹs not stupid, he
must know your mum and dad wouldnʹt risk everything without proof.ʹ 
ʹYeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,ʹ said Ron, shooting Harry a
furtive look. ʹPercy said the only evidence was your word and… I dunno… he
didnʹt think it was good enough.ʹ 
ʹPercy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,ʹ said Hermione tartly, and the others all
nodded.
ʹWhat are you talking about?ʹ Harry asked, looking around at them all. They
were all regarding him warily.
ʹHavenʹt ‐ havenʹt you been getting the Daily Prophet!ʹ Hermione asked
nervously.
ʹYeah, I have!ʹ said Harry.
ʹHave you ‐ er ‐ been reading it thoroughly?ʹ Hermione asked, still more
anxiously.
ʹNot cover to cover,ʹ said Harry defensively. ʹIf they were going to report
anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldnʹt it?ʹ 
The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on, ʹWell, youʹd
need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they ‐ um ‐ they mention you a
couple of times a week.ʹ 
ʹBut Iʹd have seen ‐ʹ 
ʹNot if youʹve only been reading the front page, you wouldnʹt,ʹ said Hermione,
shaking her head. ʹIʹm not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like
youʹre a standing joke.ʹ 
ʹWhat dʹyou ‐?ʹ 
ʹItʹs quite nasty, actually,ʹ said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. Theyʹre just
building on Ritaʹs stuff.ʹ 
ʹBut sheʹs not writing for them any more, is she?ʹ 
ʹOh, no, sheʹs kept her promise ‐ not that sheʹs got any choice,ʹ Hermione added
with satisfaction. ʹBut she laid the foundation for what theyʹre trying to do now.ʹ 
ʹWhich is what?ʹ said Harry impatiently.
ʹOK, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying
your scar was hurting and all that?ʹ 
ʹYeah,ʹ said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeters stories about him in
a hurry.
ʹWell, theyʹre writing about you as though youʹre this deluded, attention‐seeking
person who thinks heʹs a great tragic hero or something,ʹ said Hermione, very
fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly.
ʹThey keep slipping in snide comments about you. If some far‐fetched story
appears, they say something like, ʺA tale worthy of Harry Potterʺ, and if anyone
has a funny accident or anything itʹs, ʺLetʹs hope he hasnʹt got a scar on his
forehead or weʹll be asked to worship him nextʺ ‐ʹ 
ʹI donʹt want anyone to worship ‐ʹ Harry began hotly.
ʹI know you donʹt,ʹ said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. ʹI know, Harry.
But you see what theyʹre doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody
will believe. Fudge is behind it, Iʹll bet anything. They want wizards on the street
to think youʹre just some stupid boy whoʹs a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall
stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.ʹ 
ʹI didnʹt ask ‐ I didnʹt want ‐ Voldemort killed my parents!ʹ Harry spluttered. ʹI got
famous because he murdered my family but couldnʹt kill me! Who wants to be
famous for that? Donʹt they think Iʹd rather itʹd never ‐ʹ 
ʹWe know, Harry,ʹ said Ginny earnestly.
ʹAnd of course, they didnʹt report a word about the Dementors attacking you,ʹ 
said Hermione. ʹSomeoneʹs told them to keep that quiet. That shouldʹve been a
really big story, out‐of‐control Dementors. They havenʹt even reported that you
broke the International Statute of Secrecy. We thought they would, it would tie in
so well with this image of you as some stupid show‐off. We think theyʹre biding
their time until youʹre expelled, then theyʹre really going to go to town ‐ I mean,
if youʹre expelled, obviously,ʹ she went on hastily. ʹYou really shouldnʹt be, not if
they abide by their own laws, thereʹs no case against you.ʹ 
They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about that. He
cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding
one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs.
ʹUh oh.ʹ 
Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he
and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs Weasley appeared in the bedroom
doorway.
ʹThe meetingʹs over, you can come down and have dinner now. Everyoneʹs dying
to see you, Harry. And whoʹs left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?ʹ 
ʹCrookshanks,ʹ said Ginny unblusingly. ʹHe loves playing with them.ʹ 
ʹOh,ʹ said Mrs Weasley, ʹI thought it might have been Kreacher, he keeps doing
odd things like that. Now donʹt forget to keep your voices down in the hall.
Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing? Go and wash them
before dinner, please.ʹ 
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving
Harry alone with Ron and Hermione. Both of them were watching him
apprehensively, as though they feared he would start shouting again now that
everyone else had gone. The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel
slightly ashamed.
ʹLook…ʹ he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, ʹWe
knew youʹd be angry, Harry, we really donʹt blame you, but youʹve got to
understand, we did try to persuade Dumbledore ‐ʹ 
ʹYeah, I know,ʹ said Harry shortly.
He cast around for a topic that didnʹt involve his headmaster, because the very
thought of Dumbledore made Harryʹs insides burn with anger again.
ʹWhoʹs Kreacher?ʹ he asked.
The house‐elf who lives here,ʹ said Ron. ʹNutter. Never met one like him.ʹ 
Hermione frowned at Ron.
ʹHeʹs not a nutter, Ron.ʹ 
ʹHis lifeʹs ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like
his mother,ʹ said Ron irritably. ʹIs that normal, Hermione?ʹ 
ʹWell ‐ well, if he is a bit strange, itʹs not his fault.ʹ 
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry.
ʹHermione still hasnʹt given up on SPEW ‐ʹ 
ʹItʹs not SPEW!ʹ said Hermione heatedly. ʹItʹs the Society for the Promotion of
Elfish Welfare. And itʹs not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to
Kreacher too.ʹ 
ʹYeah, yeah,ʹ said Ron. ʹCʹmon, Iʹm starving.ʹ 
He led the way out of the door and on to the landing, but before they could
descend the stairs ‐ 
ʹHold it!ʹ Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking
any further. Theyʹre still in the hall, we might be able to hear something.ʹ 
The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy hallway
below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harrys guard.
They were whispering excitedly together. In the very centre of the group Harry
saw the dark, greasy‐haired head and prominent nose of his least favourite
teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leant further over the banisters. He
was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix…
A thin piece of flesh‐coloured string descended in front of Harrys eyes. Looking
up, he saw Ered and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the
Extendable Ear towards the dark knot of people below. A moment later,
however, they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight.
ʹDammit,ʹ Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable Ear back up
again.
They heard the front door open, then close.
ʹSnape never eats here,ʹ Ron told Harry quietly. Thank God. Cʹmon.ʹ 
ʹAnd donʹt forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,ʹ Hermione
whispered.
As they passed the row of house‐elf heads on the wall, they saw Lupin, Mrs
Weasley and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts
behind those who had just left.
ʹWeʹre eating down in the kitchen,ʹ Mrs Weasley whispered, meeting them at the
bottom of the stairs. ʹHarry, dear, if youʹll just tiptoe across the hall, itʹs through
this door here ‐ʹ 
CRASH.
ʹTonks!ʹ cried Mrs Weasley in exasperation, turning to look behind her.
ʹIʹm sorry!ʹ wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. ʹItʹs that stupid
umbrella stand, thatʹs the second time Iʹve tripped over ‐ʹ 
But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, ear‐splitting, blood‐
curdling screech.
The moth‐eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but
there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry thought he was
looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black
cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being tortured ‐ then he
realised it was simply a life‐size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most
unpleasant, he had ever seen in his life.
The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of her
face stretched taut as she screamed; and all along the hall behind them, the other
portraits awoke and began to yell, too, so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes
at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears.
Lupin and Mrs Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over
the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever,
brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces.
ʹFilth! Scum! By‐products of dirt and vileness! Half‐breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from
this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers ‐ʹ
Tonks apologised over and over again, dragging the huge, heavy trollʹs leg back
off the floor; Mrs Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and
hurried up and down the hall, stunning all the other portraits with her wand;
and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry.
ʹShut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!ʹ he roared, seizing the curtain Mrs
Weasley had abandoned.
The old womanʹs face blanched.
ʹYoooou!ʹ she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. ʹBlood traitor,
abomination, shame of my flesh!ʹ 
ʹI said ‐ shut ‐ UP!ʹ roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he and Lupin
managed to force the curtains closed again.
The old womanʹs screeches died and an echoing silence fell. Panting slightly and
sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, Harryʹs godfather Sirius turned to
face him.
ʹHello, Harry,ʹ he said grimly, ʹI see youʹve met my mother.ʹ 
CHAPTER FIVE 
The Order of the Phoenix
ʹYour ‐?ʹ 
ʹMy dear old mum, yeah,ʹ said Sirius. ʹWeʹve been trying to get her down for a
month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the
canvas. Letʹs get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.ʹ 
ʹBut whatʹs a portrait of your mother doing here?ʹ Harry asked, bewildered, as
they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of
narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.
ʹHasnʹt anyone told you? This was my parentsʹ house,ʹ said Sirius. ʹBut Iʹm the
last Black left, so itʹs mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for Headquarters ‐ 
about the only useful thing Iʹve been able to do.ʹ 
Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Siriusʹs
voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through
a door leading into the basement kitchen.
It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough
stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the
room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which
loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark
ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long
wooden table stood in the middle of them, littered with rolls of parchment,
goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr Weasley
and his eldest son Bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of
the table.
Mrs Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red‐haired man
who wore horn‐rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet.
ʹHarry!ʹ Mr Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him, and shaking his hand
vigorously. ʹGood to see you!ʹ 
Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail,
hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.
ʹJourney all right, Harry?ʹ Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once.
ʹMad‐Eye didnʹt make you come via Greenland, then?ʹ 
ʹHe tried,ʹ said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately toppling a
candle on to the last piece of parchment. ʹOh no ‐ sorry ‐
ʹHere, dear,ʹ said Mrs Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the
parchment with a wave of her wand. In the flash of light caused by Mrs
Weasleyʹs charm Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a
building.
Mrs Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and
stuffed it into Billʹs already overladen arms.
ʹThis sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,ʹ she
snapped, before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started
unloading dinner plates.
Bill took out his wand, muttered, ʹEvanesco!ʹ and the scrolls vanished.
ʹSit down, Harry,ʹ said Sirius. ʹYouʹve met Mundungus, havenʹt you?ʹ 
The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore,
then jerked awake.
ʹSomeʹn say mʹname?ʹ Mundungus mumbled sleepily. ʹI ʹgree with Sirius…ʹ He
raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot
eyes unfocused.
Ginny giggled.
ʹThe meetingʹs over, Dung,ʹ said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the
table. ʹHarryʹs arrived.ʹ 
ʹEh?ʹ said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his matted ginger
hair. ʹBlimey, so ʹe ʹas. Yeah… you all right, ʹAny?ʹ 
ʹYeah,ʹ said Harry.
Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled
out a grimy black pipe. He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his
wand and took a deep pull on it. Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke
obscured him within seconds.
ʹOwe you a ʹpology,ʹ grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud.
ʹFor the last time, Mundungus,ʹ called Mrs Weasley, ʹwill you please not smoke
that thing in the kitchen, especially not when weʹre about to eat!ʹ 
ʹAh,ʹ said Mundungus. ʹRight. Sorry, Molly.ʹ 
The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket,
but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.
ʹAnd if you want dinner before midnight Iʹll need a hand,ʹ Mrs Weasley said to
the room at large. ʹNo, you can stay where you are, Harry dear, youʹve had a
long journey.ʹ 
ʹWhat can I do, Molly?ʹ said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forwards.
Mrs Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive.
ʹEr ‐ no, itʹs all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, youʹve done enough today.ʹ 
ʹNo, no, I want to help!ʹ said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as she hurried
towards the dresser, from which Ginny was collecting cutlery.
Soon, a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own
accord, supervised by Mr Weasley, while Mrs Weasley stirred a cauldron
dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets and food from
the pantry. Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still
blinking at him mournfully.
ʹSeen old Figgy since?ʹ he asked.
ʹNo,ʹ said Harry, ʹI havenʹt seen anyone.ʹ 
ʹSee, I wouldnʹt ʹave left,ʹ said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in
his voice, ʹbut I ʹad a business opportunity ‐ʹ 
Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only
Crookshanks, Hermioneʹs bandy‐legged ginger cat, who wound himself once
around Harryʹs legs, purring, then jumped on to Siriusʹs lap and curled up. Sirius
scratched him absent‐mindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim‐faced, to
Harry.
ʹHad a good summer so far?ʹ 
ʹNo, itʹs been lousy,ʹ said Harry.
For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Siriusʹs face.
ʹDonʹt know what youʹre complaining about, myself.ʹ 
ʹWhat?ʹ said Harry incredulously.
ʹPersonally, Iʹd have welcomed a Dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul
would have broken the monotony nicely. You think youʹve had it bad, at least
youʹve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights…
Iʹve been stuck inside for a month.ʹ 
ʹHow come?ʹ asked Harry, frowning.
ʹBecause the Ministry of Magicʹs still after me, and Voldemort will know all
about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big
disguise is useless. Thereʹs not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix… or
so Dumbledore feels.ʹ 
There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius
uttered Dumbledoreʹs name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy
with the Headmaster. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather.
At least youʹve known whatʹs been going on,ʹ he said bracingly.
ʹOh yeah,ʹ said Sirius sarcastically. ʹListening to Snapeʹs reports, having to take all
his snide hints that heʹs out there risking his life while Iʹm sat on my backside
here having a nice comfortable time… asking me how the cleanings going ‐ʹ 
ʹWhat cleaning?ʹ asked Harry.
Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,ʹ said Sirius, waving a hand
around the dismal kitchen. ʹNo oneʹs lived here for ten years, not since my dear
mother died, unless you count her old house‐elf, and heʹs gone round the twist ‐ 
hasnʹt cleaned anything in ages.ʹ 
ʹSirius,ʹ said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to the
conversation, but had been closely examining an empty goblet. ʹThis solid silver,
mate?ʹ 
ʹYes,ʹ said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. ʹFinest fifteenth‐century goblin‐
wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.ʹ 
Thatʹd come orf, though,ʹ muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his cuff.
ʹFred ‐ George ‐ NO, JUST CARRY THEM!ʹ Mrs Weasley shrieked.
Harry, Sirius and Mundungus looked round and, within a split second, they had
dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of
stew, an iron flagon of Butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete
with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them. The stew skidded the length
of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on
the wooden surface; the flagon of Butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents
everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and
quivering ominously, exactly where Siriusʹs right hand had been seconds before.
ʹFOR HEAVENʹS SAKE!ʹ screamed Mrs Weasley. THERE WAS NO NEED ‐ IʹVE
HAD ENOUGH OF THIS ‐ JUST BECAUSE YOUʹRE ALLOWED TO USE
MAGIC NOW, YOU DONʹT HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY
TINY LITTLE THING!ʹ 
ʹWe were just trying to save a bit of time!ʹ said Fred, hurrying forward to wrench
the bread knife out of the table. ʹSorry, Sirius, mate ‐ didnʹt mean to ‐ʹ 
Harry and Sirius were both laughing; Mundungus, who had toppled backwards
off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet; Crookshanks had given an angry
hiss and shot off under the dresser, from where his large yellow eyes glowed in
the darkness.
ʹBoys,ʹ Mr Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, ʹyour
motherʹs right, youʹre supposed to show a sense of responsibility now youʹve
come of age ‐ʹ 
ʹNone of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!ʹ Mrs Weasley raged at the
twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of Butterbeer on to the table, and spilling
almost as much again. ʹBill didnʹt feel the need to Apparate every few feet!
Charlie didnʹt charm everything he met! Percy ‐ʹ 
She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband,
whose expression was suddenly wooden.
ʹLetʹs eat,ʹ said Bill quickly.
ʹIt looks wonderful, Molly,ʹ said Lupin, ladling stew on to a plate for her and
handing it across the table.
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and
the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food. Then Mrs Weasley
turned to Sirius.
ʹIʹve been meaning to tell you, Sirius, thereʹs something trapped in that writing
desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just
be a Boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we
let it out.ʹ 
ʹWhatever you like,ʹ said Sirius indifferently.
ʹThe curtains in there are full of Doxys, too,ʹ Mrs Weasley went on. ʹI thought we
might try and tackle them tomorrow.ʹ 
ʹI look forward to it,ʹ said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice, but he was
not sure that anyone else did.
Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming
her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same
pained expression she had worn back in Harryʹs bedroom, her nose swelled to a
beak‐like protuberance that resembled Snapeʹs, shrank to the size of a button
mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently
this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were
soon requesting their favourite noses.
ʹDo that one like a pig snout, Tonks.ʹ 
Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female
Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.
Mr Weasley, Bill and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins.
Theyʹre not giving anything away yet,ʹ said Bill. ʹI still canʹt work out whether or
not they believe heʹs back. Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. Keep
out of it.ʹ 
ʹIʹm sure theyʹd never go over to You‐Know‐Who,ʹ said Mr Weasley, shaking his
head. Theyʹve suffered losses too; remember that goblin family he murdered last
time, somewhere near Nottingham?ʹ 
ʹI think it depends what theyʹre offered,ʹ said Lupin. ʹAnd Iʹm not talking about
gold. If theyʹre offered the freedoms weʹve been denying them for centuries
theyʹre going to be tempted. Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill?ʹ 
ʹHeʹs feeling pretty anti‐wizard at the moment,ʹ said Bill, ʹhe hasnʹt stopped
raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover‐up, those
goblins never got their gold from him, you know ‐ʹ 
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Billʹs words.
Fred, George, Ron and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats.
ʹ… and then,ʹ choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, ʹand then, if
youʹll believe it, ʹe says to me, ʹe says, ʺʹEre, Dung, where didja get all them toads
from? ʹCos some son of a Bludgerʹs gone and nicked all mine!ʺ And I says,
ʺNicked all your toads, Will, what next? So youʹll be wanting some more, then?ʺ 
And if youʹll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all ʹis own toads back
orf me for a lot moreʹn what ʹe paid in the first place ‐ʹ 
ʹw donʹt think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you
very much, Mundungus,ʹ said Mrs Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forwards
on to the table, howling with laughter.
ʹBeg pardon, Molly,ʹ said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and winking at
Harry. ʹBut, you know, Will nicked ʹem orf Warty Harris in the first place so I
wasnʹt really doing nothing wrong.ʹ 
ʹI donʹt know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you
seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,ʹ said Mrs Weasley coldly.
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of Butterbeer; George was
hiccoughing. For some reason, Mrs Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius
before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding.
Harry looked round at his godfather.
ʹMolly doesnʹt approve of Mundungus,ʹ said Sirius in an undertone.
ʹHow come heʹs in the Order?ʹ Harry said, very quietly.
ʹHeʹs useful,ʹ Sirius muttered. ʹKnows all the crooks ‐ well, he would, seeing as
heʹs one himself. But heʹs also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of
a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we
donʹt. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasnʹt
forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.ʹ 
Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on
Harrys jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something as
the jeans had once been Dudleyʹs). As he laid down his spoon there was a lull in
the general conversation: Mr Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking
replete and relaxed; Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal;
and Ginny who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting
cross‐legged on the floor, rolling Butterbeer corks for him to chase.
ʹNearly time for bed, I think,ʹ said Mrs Weasley with a yawn.
ʹNot just yet, Mollyʹ said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to
look at Harry. ʹYou know, Iʹm surprised at you. I thought the first thing youʹd do
when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.ʹ 
The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the
arrival of Dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was
now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of
Voldemortʹs name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his
goblet slowly, looking wary.
ʹI did!ʹ said Harry indignantly. ʹI asked Ron and Hermione but they said weʹre
not allowed in the Order, so ‐ʹ 
ʹAnd theyʹre quite right,ʹ said Mrs Weasley. ʹYouʹre too young.ʹ 
She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched on its arms, every
trace of drowsiness gone.
ʹSince when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask
questions?ʹ asked Sirius. ʹHarryʹs been trapped in that Muggle house for a month.
Heʹs got the right to know whatʹs been happen—ʹ 
ʹHang on!ʹ interrupted George loudly.
ʹHow come Harry gets his questions answered?ʹ said Fred angrily.
ʹWeʹve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you havenʹt told us a
single stinking thing!ʹ said George.
ʹʺYouʹre too young, youʹre not in the Order,ʹʺ said Fred, in a high‐pitched voice that
sounded uncannily like his motherʹs. ʹHarryʹs not even of age!ʹ 
ʹItʹs not my fault you havenʹt been told what the Orderʹs doing,ʹ said Sirius
calmly, ʹthatʹs your parentsʹ decision. Harry, on the other hand ‐ʹ 
ʹItʹs not down to you to decide whatʹs good for Harry!ʹ said Mrs Weasley sharply.
The expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous. ʹYou havenʹt
forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?ʹ 
ʹWhich bit?ʹ Sirius asked politely, but with the air of a man readying himself for a
fight.
The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,ʹ said Mrs Weasley,
placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
Ron, Hermione, Fred and Georgeʹs heads swivelled from Sirius to Mrs Weasley
as though they were following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of
abandoned Butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly
open. Lupinʹs eyes were fixed on Sirius.
ʹI donʹt intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,ʹ said Sirius. ʹBut as
he was the one who saw Voldemort come backʹ (again, there was a collective
shudder around the table at the name) ʹhe has more right than most to ‐ʹ 
ʹHeʹs not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!ʹ said Mrs Weasley. ʹHeʹs only
fifteen and ‐ʹ 
ʹAnd heʹs dealt with as much as most in the Order,ʹ said Sirius, ʹand more than
some.ʹ 
ʹNo oneʹs denying what heʹs done!ʹ said Mrs Weasley, her voice rising, her fists
trembling on the arms of her chair. ʹBut heʹs still ‐ʹ 
ʹHeʹs not a child!ʹ said Sirius impatiently.
ʹHeʹs not an adult either!ʹ said Mrs Weasley, the colour rising in her cheeks. ʹHeʹs
not James, Sirius!ʹ 
ʹIʹm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,ʹ said Sirius coldly.
ʹIʹm not sure you are!ʹ said Mrs Weasley. ʹSometimes, the way you talk about
him, itʹs as though you think youʹve got your best friend back!ʹ 
ʹWhatʹs wrong with that?ʹ said Harry.
ʹWhatʹs wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might
look like him!ʹ said Mrs Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. ʹYou are still at
school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!ʹ 
ʹMeaning Iʹm an irresponsible godfather?ʹ demanded Sirius, his voice rising.
ʹMeaning you have been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore
keeps reminding you to stay at home and ‐ʹ 
ʹWeʹll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!ʹ said
Sirius loudly.
ʹArthur!ʹ said Mrs Weasley, rounding on her husband. ʹArthur, back me up!ʹ 
Mr Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and cleaned them
slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them
carefully on his nose did he reply.
ʹDumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will
have to be filled in, to a certain extent, now that he is staying at Headquarters.ʹ 
ʹYes, but thereʹs a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he
likes!ʹ 
ʹPersonally,ʹ said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs Weasley
turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, ʹI think it
better that Harry gets the facts ‐not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture ‐ 
from us, rather than a garbled version from… others.ʹ 
His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure Lupin, at least, knew that some
Extendable Ears had survived Mrs Weasleyʹs purge.
ʹWell,ʹ said Mrs Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for
support that did not come, ʹwell… I can see Iʹm going to be overruled. Iʹll just say
this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too
much, and speaking as someone who has Harryʹs best interests at heart ‐ʹ 
ʹHeʹs not your son,ʹ said Sirius quietly.
ʹHeʹs as good as,ʹ said Mrs Weasley fiercely. ʹWho else has he got?ʹ 
ʹHeʹs got me!ʹ 
ʹYes,ʹ said Mrs Weasley, her lip curling, ʹthe thing is, itʹs been rather difficult for
you to look after him while youʹve been locked UP in Azkaban, hasnʹt it?ʹ 
Sirius started to rise from his chair.
ʹMolly, youʹre not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,ʹ said
Lupin sharply. ʹSirius, sit down.ʹ 
Mrs Weasleyʹs lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his chair, his
face white.
ʹI think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,ʹ Lupin continued, ʹheʹs old
enough to decide for himself.ʹ 
ʹI want to know whatʹs been going on,ʹ Harry said at once.
He did not look at Mrs Weasley. He had been touched by what she had said
about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient with her
mollycoddling. Sirius was right, he was not a child.
ʹVery well,ʹ said Mrs Weasley, her voice cracking. ʹGinny ‐ Ron ‐ Hermione ‐ Fred
‐ George ‐ I want you out of this kitchen, now.ʹ 
There was instant uproar.
ʹWeʹre of age!ʹ Fred and George bellowed together.
ʹIf Harryʹs allowed, why canʹt I?ʹ shouted Ron.
ʹMum, I want to hear!ʹ wailed Ginny.
ʹNO!ʹ shouted Mrs Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. ʹI absolutely forbid
‐ʹ 
ʹMolly, you canʹt stop Fred and George,ʹ said Mr Weasley wearily. They are of
age.ʹ 
Theyʹre still at school.ʹ 
ʹBut theyʹre legally adults now,ʹ said Mr Weasley, in the same tired voice.
Mrs Weasley was now scarlet in the face.
ʹI ‐ oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron ‐ʹ 
ʹHarryʹll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!ʹ said Ron hotly.
ʹWonʹt ‐ wonʹt you?ʹ he added uncertainly, meeting Harryʹs eyes.
For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldnʹt tell him a single
word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it.
But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other.
ʹCourse I will,ʹ Harry said.
Ron and Hermione beamed.
ʹFine!ʹ shouted Mrs Weasley. ʹFine! Ginny ‐ BED!ʹ 
Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming at her mother
all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs Blacks ear‐splitting
shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It
was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking
his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke.
ʹOK, Harry… what do you want to know?ʹ 
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the
last month.
ʹWhereʹs Voldemort?ʹ he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the
name. ʹWhatʹs he doing? Iʹve been trying to watch the Muggle news, and there
hasnʹt been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything.ʹ 
Thatʹs because there havenʹt been any funny deaths yet,ʹ said Sirius, ʹnot as far as
we know, anyway… and we know quite a lot.ʹ 
ʹMore than he thinks we do, anyway,ʹ said Lupin.
ʹHow come heʹs stopped killing people?ʹ Harry asked. He knew Voldemort had
murdered more than once in the last year alone.
ʹBecause he doesnʹt want to draw attention to himself,ʹ said Sirius. ʹIt would be
dangerous for him. His comeback didnʹt come off quite the way he wanted it to,
you see. He messed it up.ʹ 
ʹOr rather, you messed it tip for him,ʹ said Lupin, with a satisfied smile.
ʹHow?ʹ Harry asked, perplexed.
ʹYou werenʹt supposed to survive!ʹ said Sirius. ʹNobody apart from his Death
Eaters was supposed to know heʹd come back. But you survived to bear witness.ʹ 
ʹAnd the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back
was Dumbledore,ʹ said Lupin. ʹAnd you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.ʹ 
ʹHow has that helped?ʹ Harry asked.
ʹAre you kidding?ʹ said Bill incredulously. ʹDumbledore was the only one You‐
Know‐Who was ever scared of!ʹ 
Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an
hour after Voldemort returned,ʹ said Sirius.
ʹSo, whatʹs the Order been doing?ʹ said Harry, looking around at them all.
ʹWorking as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort canʹt carry out his plans,ʹ 
said Sirius.
ʹHow dʹyou know what his plans are?ʹ Harry asked quickly.
ʹDumbledoreʹs got a shrewd idea,ʹ said Lupin, ʹand Dumbledoreʹs shrewd ideas
normally turn out to be accurate.ʹ 
ʹSo what does Dumbledore reckon heʹs planning?ʹ 
ʹWell, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,ʹ said Sirius. ʹIn the old days he
had huge numbers at his command: witches and wizards heʹd bullied or
bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark
creatures. You heard him planning to recruit the giants; well, theyʹll be just one
of the groups heʹs after. Heʹs certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry
of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.ʹ 
ʹSo youʹre trying to stop him getting more followers?ʹ 
ʹWeʹre doing our best,ʹ said Lupin.
ʹHow?ʹ 
ʹWell, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You‐
Know‐Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,ʹ said Bill. ʹItʹs
proving tricky, though.ʹ 
ʹWhy?ʹ 
ʹBecause of the Ministryʹs attitude,ʹ said Tonks. ʹYou saw Cornelius Fudge after
You‐Know‐Who came back, Harry. Well, he hasnʹt shifted his position at all. Heʹs
absolutely refusing to believe itʹs happened.ʹ 
ʹBut why?ʹ said Harry desperately. Whyʹs he being so stupid? If Dumbledore ‐ʹ 
ʹAh, well, youʹve put your finger on the problem,ʹ said Mr Weasley with a wry
smile. ʹDumbledore.ʹ 
ʹFudge is frightened of him, you see,ʹ said Tonks sadly.
ʹFrightened of Dumbledore?ʹ said Harry incredulously.
ʹFrightened of what heʹs up to,ʹ said Mr Weasley. ʹFudge thinks Dumbledoreʹs
plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister for
Magic.ʹ 
ʹBut Dumbledore doesnʹt want ‐ʹ 
ʹOf course he doesnʹt,ʹ said Mr Weasley. ʹHeʹs never wanted the Ministerʹs job,
even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold
retired. Fudge came to power instead, but
‐ 
heʹs never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even
though Dumbledore never applied for the job.ʹ 
ʹDeep down, Fudge knows Dumbledoreʹs much cleverer than he is a much more
powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking
Dumbledore for help and advice,ʹ said Lupin. ʹBut it seems heʹs become fond of
power, and much more confident. He loves being Minister for Magic and heʹs
managed to convince himself that heʹs the clever one and Dumbledoreʹs simply
stirring up trouble for the sake of it.ʹ 
ʹHow can he think that?ʹ said Harry angrily. ʹHow can he think Dumbledore
would just make it all up ‐ that Iʹd make it all up?ʹ 
ʹBecause accepting that Voldemortʹs back would mean trouble like the Ministry
hasnʹt had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,ʹ said Sirius bitterly. ʹFudge just
canʹt bring himself to face it. Itʹs so much more comfortable to convince himself
Dumbledoreʹs lying to destabilise him.ʹ 
ʹYou see the problem,ʹ said Lupin. ʹWhile the Ministry insists there is nothing to
fear from Voldemort itʹs hard to convince people heʹs back, especially as they
really donʹt want to believe it in the first place. Whatʹs more, the Ministryʹs
leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what theyʹre calling
Dumbledoreʹs rumour‐mongering, so most of the wizarding community are
completely unaware any things happened, and that makes them easy targets for
the Death Eaters if theyʹre using the Imperius Curse.ʹ 
ʹBut youʹre telling people, arenʹt you?ʹ said Harry, looking around at Mr Weasley,
Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin and Tonks. ʹYouʹre letting people know heʹs
back?ʹ 
They all smiled humourlessly.
ʹWell, as everyone thinks Iʹm a mad mass‐murderer and the Ministryʹs put a ten
thousand Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start
handing out leaflets, can I?ʹ said Sirius restlessly.
ʹAnd Iʹm not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,ʹ said
Lupin. ʹItʹs an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.ʹ 
ʹTonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting
their mouths off,ʹ said Sirius, ʹand itʹs very important for us to have spies inside
the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.ʹ 
ʹWeʹve managed to convince a couple of people, though,ʹ said Mr Weasley. Tonks
here, for one ‐ sheʹs too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time,
and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage ‐ Kingsley Shackleboltʹs been
a real asset, too; heʹs in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so heʹs been feeding the
Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet.ʹ 
ʹBut if none of you are putting the news out that Voldemorts back ‐ʹ Harry began.
ʹWho said none of us are putting the news out?ʹ said Sirius. Why dʹyou think
Dumbledoreʹs in such trouble?ʹ 
ʹWhat dʹyou mean?ʹ Harry asked.
Theyʹre trying to discredit him,ʹ said Lupin. ʹDidnʹt you see the Daily Prophet last
week? They reported that heʹd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the
International Confederation of Wizards because heʹs getting old and losing his
grip, but itʹs not true; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a
speech announcing Voldemorts return. Theyʹve demoted him from Chief
Warlock on the Wizengamot ‐ thatʹs the Wizard High Court ‐ and theyʹre talking
about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.ʹ 
ʹBut Dumbledore says he doesnʹt care what they do as long as they donʹt take
him off the Chocolate Frog Cards,ʹ said Bill, grinning.
ʹItʹs no laughing matter,ʹ said Mr Weasley sharply. ʹIf he carries on defying the
Ministry like this he could end up in Azkaban, and the last thing we want is to
have Dumbledore locked up. While You‐Know‐Who knows Dumbledoreʹs out
there and wise to what heʹs up to heʹs going to go cautiously. If Dumbledoreʹs
out ol the way ‐ well, You‐Know‐Who will have a clear field.ʹ 
ʹBut if Voldemortʹs trying to recruit more Death Eaters itʹs bound to get out that
heʹs come back, isnʹt it?ʹ asked Harry desperately.
ʹVoldemort doesnʹt march up to peopleʹs houses and bang on their front doors,
Harry,ʹ said Sirius. ʹHe tricks, jinxes and blackmails them. Heʹs well‐practised at
operating in secret. In any case, gathering followers is only one thing heʹs
interested in. Heʹs got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very
quietly indeed, and heʹs concentrating on those for the moment.ʹ 
ʹWhatʹs he after apart from followers?ʹ Harry asked swiftly. He thought he saw
Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius answered.
ʹStuff he can only get by stealth.ʹ 
When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, ʹLike a weapon. Something
he didnʹt have last time.ʹ 
ʹWhen he was powerful before?ʹ 
ʹYes.ʹ 
ʹLike what kind of weapon?ʹ said Harry. ʹSomething worse than the Avada
Kedavra ‐?ʹ 
ʹThatʹs enough!ʹ 
Mrs Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry hadnʹt noticed her
return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and she looked
furious.
ʹI want you in bed, now. All of you,ʹ she added, looking around at Fred, George,
Ron and Hermione.
ʹYou canʹt boss us ‐ʹ Fred began.
ʹWatch me,ʹ snarled Mrs Weasley. She was trembling slightly as she looked at
Sirius. ʹYouʹve given Harry plenty of information. Any more and you might just
as well induct him into the Order straightaway.ʹ 
ʹWhy not?ʹ said Harry quickly. Til join, I want to join, I want to fight.ʹ 
ʹNo.ʹ 
It was not Mrs Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.
The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,ʹ he said. ʹWizards who have left
school,ʹ he added, as Fred and Georg^ opened their mouths. There are dangers
involved of which you can have no idea, any of you… I think Mollyʹs right,
Sirius. Weʹve said enough.ʹ 
Sirius half‐shrugged but did not argue. Mrs Weasley beckoned imperiously to
her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognising
defeat, followed suit.
 CHAPTER SIX
The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black
Mrs Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.
ʹI want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,ʹ she said as they reached the first
landing, ʹweʹve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginnyʹs asleep,ʹ she added to
Hermione, ʹso try not to wake her up.ʹ 
ʹAsleep, yeah, right,ʹ said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them
goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor. ʹIf Ginnyʹs not lying awake
waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then Iʹm a
Flobberworm…ʹ 
ʹAll right, Ron, Harry,ʹ said Mrs Weasley on the second landing, pointing them
into their bedroom. ʹOff to bed with you.ʹ 
ʹNight,ʹ Harry and Ron said to the twins.
ʹSleep tight,ʹ said Fred, winking.
Mrs Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The bedroom
looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The
blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply, as though
its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his pyjamas, took off his glasses
and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the
wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and
rustling their wings restlessly.
ʹWe canʹt let them out to hunt every night,ʹ Ron explained as he pulled on his
maroon pyjamas. ʹDumbledore doesnʹt want too many owls swooping around
the square, thinks itʹll look suspicious. Oh yeah… I forgot…ʹ 
He crossed to the door and bolted it.
ʹWhatʹre you doing that for?ʹ 
ʹKreacher,ʹ said Ron as he turned off the light. ʹFirst night I was here he came
wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you donʹt want to wake up and
find him prowling around your room. Anyway…ʹ he got into his bed, settled
down under the covers then turned to look at Harry in the darkness; Harry could
see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window, ʹwhat
dʹyou reckon?ʹ 
Harry didnʹt need to ask what Ron meant.
ʹWell, they didnʹt tell us much we couldnʹt have guessed, did they?ʹ he said,
thinking of all that had been said downstairs. ʹI mean, all theyʹve really said is
that the Orderʹs trying to stop people joining Vol—ʹ 
There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.
ʹdemort,ʹ said Harry firmly. ʹWhen are you going to start using his name? Sirius
and Lupin do.ʹ 
Ron ignored this last comment.
ʹYeah, youʹre right,ʹ he said, ʹwe already knew nearly everything they told us,
from using the Extendable Ears. The only new bit was ‐ʹ 
Crack.
ʹOUCH!ʹ 
ʹKeep your voice down, Ron, or Mumʹll be back up here.ʹ 
ʹYou two just Apparated on my knees!ʹ 
ʹYeah, well, itʹs harder in the dark.ʹ 
Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Ronʹs
bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harryʹs mattress descended a few
inches as George sat down near his feet.
ʹSo, got there yet?ʹ said George eagerly.
The weapon Sirius mentioned?ʹ said Harry.
ʹLet slip, more like,ʹ said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. ʹWe didnʹt
hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?ʹ 
ʹWhat dʹyou reckon it is?ʹ said Harry.
ʹCould be anything,ʹ said Fred.
ʹBut there canʹt be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra Curse, can there?ʹ 
said Ron. Whatʹs worse than death?ʹ 
ʹMaybe itʹs something that can kill loads of people at once,ʹ suggested George.
ʹMaybe itʹs some particularly painful way of killing people,ʹ said Ron fearfully.
ʹHeʹs got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,ʹ said Harry, ʹhe doesnʹt need
anything more efficient than that.ʹ 
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were wondering
what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.
ʹSo who dʹyou thinkʹs got it now?ʹ asked George.
ʹI hope itʹs our side,ʹ said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.
ʹIf it is, Dumbledoreʹs probably keeping it,ʹ said Fred. *!
ʹWhere?ʹ said Ron quickly. ʹHogwarts?ʹ •ʹ 
ʹBet it is!ʹ said George. Thatʹs where he hid the Philosopherʹs Stone.ʹ 
ʹA weapons going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!ʹ said Ron.
ʹNot necessarilyʹ said Fred.
ʹYeah, size is no guarantee of power,ʹ said George. ʹLook at Ginny.ʹ 
ʹWhat dʹyou mean?ʹ said Harry.
ʹYouʹve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat‐Bogey Hexes, have
you?ʹ 
ʹShhh!ʹ said Fred, half‐rising irom the bed. ʹListen!ʹ 
They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs.
ʹMum,ʹ said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry
felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later, they heard
the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs Weasley was plainly listening to
check whether or not they were talking.
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again and
they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.
ʹShe doesnʹt trust us at all, you know,ʹ said Ron regretfully.
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so
packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours
mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs Weasley was
now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard
others making their way upstairs… in fact, many‐legged creatures were
cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid the Care of
Magical Creatures teacher was saying, ʹBeauties, arm they, eh, Harry? Weʹll be
studyinʹ weapons this term …ʺ and Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for
heads and were wheeling to face him… he ducked…
The next thing he knew, he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and
Georges loud voice was filling the room.
ʹMum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the
drawing room, there are loads more Doxys than she thought and sheʹs found a
nest of dead Puffskeins under the sofa.ʹ 
Half an hour later Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly,
entered the drawing room, a long, high‐ceilinged room on the first floor with
olive green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet exhaled little clouds of
dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long, moss green velvet
curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees. It was around
these that Mrs Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred and George were grouped, all
looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth.
Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the
end.
ʹCover your faces and take a spray,ʹ Mrs Weasley said to Harry and Ron the
moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a
spindle‐legged table. ʹItʹs Doxycide. Iʹve never seen an infestation this bad ‐ what
that house‐elfʹs been doing for the last ten years ‐ʹ 
Hermioneʹs face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly saw her
throw a reproachful look at Mrs Weasley.
ʹKreacherʹs really old, he probably couldnʹt manage ‐ʹ 
ʹYouʹd be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to, Hermione,ʹ 
said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what
appeared to be dead rats. ʹIʹve just been feeding Buckbeak,ʹ he added, in reply to
Harrys enquiring look. ʹI keep him upstairs in my mothers bedroom. Anyway…
this writing desk…ʹ 
He dropped the bag of rals into an armchair, then bent over Jo examine the
locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the fülst time, was shaking slightly.
ʹWell, Molly, Iʹm pretty sure this is a Boggart,ʹ said Sirius, peering through the
keyhole, ʹbut perhaps we ought to let Mad‐Eye have a shifty at it before we let it
out ‐ knowing my mother, it could be something much worse.ʹ 
ʹRight you are, Sirius,ʹ said Mrs Weasley.
They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite
plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before.
A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the
cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by
Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.
ʹI keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!ʹ said Sirius exas‐peratedly, hurrying
out of the room. They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs Blackʹs
screeches echoed up through the house once more:
ʹStains, of dishonour, filthy half‐breeds, blood traitors, children of filth
ʹClose the door, please, Harry,ʹ said Mrs Weasley.
Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing‐room door; he wanted
to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to shut
the curtains over his motherʹs portrait because she had stopped screaming. He
heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front
door, and then a deep voice he recognised as Kingsley Shackleboltʹs saying,
ʹHestiaʹs just relieved me, so sheʹs got Moodyʹs Cloak now, thought Iʹd leave a
report for Dumbledore…ʹ 
Feeling Mrs Weasleyʹs eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully closed the
drawing‐room door and rejoined the Doxy party.
Mrs Weasley was bending over to check the page on Doxys in Gilderoy Lockhartʹs
Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.
ʹRight, you lot, you need to be careful, because Doxys bite and their teeth are
poisonous. Iʹve got a bottle of antidote here, but Iʹd rather nobody needed it.ʹ 
She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and
beckoned them all forward.
ʹWhen I say the word, start spraying immediately,ʹ she said. Theyʹll come Hying
out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them.
When theyʹre immobilised, just throw them in this bucket.ʹ 
She stepped carefully out of their line of fire, and raised her own spray.
ʹAll right ‐ squirt!ʹ 
Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully‐grown Doxy came
soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetle‐like wings whirring, tiny
needle‐sharp teeth bared, its fairy‐like body covered with thick black hair and its
four tiny lists clenched with fury. Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of
Doxycide. It froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, on to the
worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket.
ʹFred, what are you doing?ʹ said Mrs Weasley sharply. ʹSpray that at once and
throw it away!ʹ 
Harry looked round. Fred was holding a struggling Doxy between his forefinger
and thumb.
ʹRight‐o,ʹ Fred said brightly, spraying the Doxy quickly in the face so that it
fainted, but the moment Mrs Weasleyʹs back was turned he pocketed it with a
wink.
ʹWe want to experiment with Doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,ʹ George
told Harry under his breath.
Deftly spraying two Doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose, Harry
moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, ʹWhat are
Skiving Snackboxes?ʹ 
ʹRange of sweets to make you ill,ʹ George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs
Weasleyʹs back. ʹNot seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class
when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer.
Theyʹre double‐ended, colour‐coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the
Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment youʹve been rushed out of the lesson for
the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half ‐ʹ 
ʹʹ‐ which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of
your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to
unprofitable boredom.ʺ Thatʹs what weʹre putting in the adverts, anyway,ʹ 
whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs Weasleyʹs line of vision and
was now sweeping a few stray Doxys from the floor and adding them to his
pocket. ʹBut they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a
bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple
end.ʹ 
Testers?ʹ 
ʹUs,ʹ said Fred. ʹWe take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies ‐ we both
tried the Nosebleed Nougat ‐ʹ 
ʹMum thought weʹd been duelling,ʹ said George.
ʹJoke shop still on, then?ʹ Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle
on his spray.
ʹWell, we havenʹt had a chance to get premises yet,ʹ said Fred, dropping his voice
even lower as Mrs Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to
the attack, ʹso weʹre running it as a mail‐order service at the moment. We put
advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.ʹ 
ʹAll thanks to you, mate,ʹ said George. ʹBut donʹt worry… Mum hasnʹt got a clue.
She wonʹt read the Daily Prophet any more, ʹcause of it telling lies about you and
Dumbledore.ʹ 
Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand Galleons
prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realise their
ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in
furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs Weasley. She did not think running a
joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.
The de‐Doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past midday
when Mrs Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a sagging
armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of
dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from
the intensive spraying. At the foot of them unconscious Doxys lay crammed in
the bucket beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crook‐shanks was now
sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.
ʹI think weʹll tackle those after lunch.ʹ Mrs Weasley pointed at the dusty glass‐
fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed
with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled
snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry
could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a
large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs Weasley.
ʹStay here,ʹ she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs Blackʹs screeches
started up again from down below. Iʹll bring up some sandwiches.ʹ 
She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once, everyone
dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep. They could see the top
of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons.
ʹMundungus!ʹ said Hermione. ʹWhatʹs he brought all those cauldrons for?ʹ 
ʹProbably looking for a sale place to keep them,ʹ said Harry. ʹIsnʹt that what he
was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy
cauldrons?ʹ 
ʹYeah, youʹre right!ʹ said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his
cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. ʹBlimey, Mum wonʹt like
that…ʹ 
He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening closely. Mrs
Blackʹs screaming had stopped.
ʹMundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,ʹ Fred muttered, frowning with
concentration. ʹCanʹt hear properly… dʹyou reckon we can risk the Extendable
Ears?ʹ 
ʹMight be worth it,ʹ said George. ʹI could sneak upstairs and get a pair ‐ʹ 
But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs
that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear exactly
what Mrs Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice.
WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!ʹ 
I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,ʹ said Fred, with a satisfied smile
on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs Weasleyʹs voice to
permeate the room better, ʹit makes such a nice change.ʹ 
ʹ‐ COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVENʹT GOT ENOUGH TO
WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO
THE HOUSE ‐ʹ 
The idiots are letting her get into her stride,ʹ said George, shaking his head.
ʹYouʹve got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and
goes on for hours. And sheʹs been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since
he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry ‐ and there
goes Siriusʹs mum again.ʹ 
Mrs Weasleyʹs voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits
in the hall.
George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a
house‐elf edged into the room.
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely
naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and,
though it was bald like all house‐elves, there was a quantity of white hair
growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey
and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.
The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could
not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end
of the room, all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a
bullfrogs.
ʹ… smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but sheʹs no better, nasty old blood
traitor with her brats messing up my mistressʹs house, oh, my poor mistress, if
she knew, if she knew the scum theyʹve let into her house, what would she say to
old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and
thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do…ʹ 
ʹHello, Kreacher,ʹ said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.
The house‐elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very
pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.
ʹKreacher did not see young master,ʹ he said, turning around and bowing to
Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, ʹNasty little brat of a
blood traitor it is.ʹ 
ʹSorry?ʹ said George. ʹDidnʹt catch that last bit.ʹ 
ʹKreacher said nothing,ʹ said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a
clear undertone, ʹand thereʹs its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.ʹ 
Harry didnʹt know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them
all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he
continued to mutter.
ʹ… and thereʹs the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh, if my mistress
knew, oh, how sheʹd cry, and thereʹs a new boy, Kreacher doesnʹt know his
name. What is he doing here? Kreacher doesnʹt know…ʺ 
This is Harry, Kreacher,ʹ said Herrmone tentatively. ʹHarry Potter.ʹ 
Kreacherʹs pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than
ever.
The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacherʹs
mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say ‐ʹ 
ʹDonʹt call her a Mudblood!ʹ said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.
ʹIt doesnʹt matter,ʹ Hermione whispered, ʹheʹs not in his right mind, he doesnʹt
know what heʹs ‐ʹ 
ʹDonʹt kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what heʹs saying,ʹ said Fred,
eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.
ʹIs it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, thatʹs the
boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it ‐ʹ 
ʹDonʹt we all, Kreacher,ʹ said Fred.
ʹWhat do you want, anyway?ʹ George asked.
Kreacherʹs huge eyes darted towards George.
ʹKreacher is cleaning,ʹ he said evasively.
ʹA likely story,ʹ said a voice behind Harry.
Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in
the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs Weasley and Mundungus had moved their
argument down into the kitchen.
At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that
flattened his snoutltke nose on the floor.
ʹStand up straight,ʹ said Sirius impatiently. ʹNow, what are you up to?ʹ 
ʹKreacher is cleaning,ʹ the elf repeated. ʹKreacher lives to serve the Noble House
of Black ‐ʹ 
ʹAnd itʹs getting blacker every day, itʹs filthy,ʹ said Sirius.
ʹMaster always liked his little joke,ʹ said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing
in an undertone, ʹMaster was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his motherʹs
heart ‐ʹ 
ʹMy mother didnʹt have a heart, Kreacher,ʹ snapped Sirius. ʹShe kept herself alive
out of pure spite.ʹ 
Kreacher bowed again as he spoke.
ʹWhatever Master says,ʹ he muttered furiously. ʹMaster is not fit to wipe slime
from his motherʹs boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw
Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was ‐ʹ 
ʹw asked you what you were up to,ʹ said Sirius coldly. ʹEvery time you show up
pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we canʹt
throw it out.ʹ 
ʹKreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Masterʹs house,ʹ 
said the elf, then muttered very fast, ʹMistress would never forgive Kreacher if
the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries itʹs been in the family, Kreacher
must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats
destroy it ‐ʹ 
ʹI thought it might be that,ʹ said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite
wall. ʹSheʹll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I donʹt
doubt, but if w can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.ʹ 
It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the
look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and
he muttered all the way out of the room.
ʹ‐ comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress,
what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures
thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and heʹs back, they say heʹs a
murderer too ‐ʹ 
ʹKeep muttering and I will be a murderer!ʹ said Sirius irritably as he slammed the
door shut on the elf.
ʹSirius, heʹs not right in the head,ʹ Hermione pleaded, ʹw donʹt think he realises we
can hear him.ʹ 
ʹHeʹs been alone too long,ʹ said Sirius, ʹtaking mad orders from my motherʹs
portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little ‐ʹ 
ʹIf you could just set him free,ʹ said Hermione hopefully, ʹmaybe ‐ʹ 
ʹWe canʹt set him free, he knows too much about the Order,ʹ said Sirius curtly.
ʹAnd anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this
house, see how he takes it.ʹ 
Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to
protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.
The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though Doxys
had gnawed it in places. Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was
embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree
dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the
very top of the tapestry read:
The Noble and Most Ancient House oj Black Toujours purʹ 
ʹYouʹre not on here!ʹ said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree closely.
ʹI used to be there,ʹ said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the
tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. ʹMy sweet old mother blasted me off after I
ran away from home ‐ Kreacherʹs quite fond of muttering the story under his
breath.ʹ 
ʹYou ran away from home?ʹ 
ʹWhen I was about sixteen,ʹ said Sirius. ʹIʹd had enough.ʹ 
ʹWhere did you go?ʹ asked Harry, staring at him.
ʹYour dadʹs place,ʹ said Sirius. ʹYour grandparents were really good about it; they
sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dadʹs in the
school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. My Uncle
Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold ‐ heʹs been wiped off here, too, thatʹs
probably why ‐ anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at
Mr and Mrs Potterʹs for Sunday lunch, though.ʹ 
ʹBut… why did you… ?ʹ 
ʹLeave?ʹ Sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long, unkempt hair.
ʹBecause I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure‐blood mania,
convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal… my idiot brother, soft
enough to believe them… thatʹs him.ʹ 
Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name ʹRegulus Blackʹ.
A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth.
ʹHe was younger than me,ʹ said Sirius, ʹand a much better son, as w was
constantly reminded.ʹ 
ʹBut he died,ʹ said Harry.
ʹYeah,ʹ said Sirius. ʹStupid idiot… he joined the Death Eaters.ʹ 
ʹYouʹre kidding!ʹ 
ʹCome on, Harry, havenʹt you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of
wizards my family were?ʹ said Sirius testily.
ʹWere ‐ were your parents Death Eaters as well?ʹ 
ʹNo, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all
for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle‐borns and
having pure‐bloods in charge. They werenʹt alone, either, there were quite a few
people, before Voldemort showed his true colours, who thought he had the right
idea about things… they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to
do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little
hero for joining up at first.ʹ 
ʹWas he killed by an Auror?ʹ Harry asked tentatively.
ʹOh, no,ʹ said Sirius. ʹNo, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemortʹs
orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by
Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then
panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you
donʹt just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. Itʹs a lifetime of service or
death.ʹ 
ʹLunch,ʹ said Mrs Weasleys voice.
She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded
with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still looked
angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained
with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.
ʹI havenʹt looked at this for years. Thereʹs Phineas Nigellus… my great‐great‐
grandfather, see?… least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had… and
Araminta Mehflua… cousin of my mothers… tried to force through a Ministry
Bill to make Muggle‐hunting legal… and dear Aunt Elladora… she started the
family tradition of beheading house‐elves when they got too old to carry tea
trays… of course, any time the family produced someone halfway decent they
were disowned. I see Tonks isnʹt on here. Maybe thatʹs why Kreacher wonʹt take
orders from her ‐ heʹs supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him ‐ʹ 
ʹYou and Tonks are related?ʹ Harry asked, surprised.
ʹOh, yeah, her mother Andromeda was my favourite cousin,ʹ said Sirius,
examining the tapestry closely. ʹNo, Andromedaʹs not on here either, look ‐ʹ 
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and
Narcissa.
ʹAndromedaʹs sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure‐
blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle‐born, Ted Tonks, so ‐ʹ 
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry,
however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of
Andromedaʹs burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa
Black with Lucius Malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to
the name Draco.
ʹYouʹre related to the Malfoys!ʹ 
The pure‐blood families are all interrelated,ʹ said Sirius. Tf youʹre only going to
let your sons and daughters marry pure‐bloods your choice is very limited; there
are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthurʹs
something like my second cousin once removed. But thereʹs no point looking for
them on here ‐ if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors itʹs the Weasleys.ʹ 
But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromedaʹs burn:
Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange.
ʹLestrange…ʹ Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his memory;
he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldnʹt think where, though it
gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach.
Theyʹre in Azkaban,ʹ said Sirius shortly.
Harry looked at him curiously.
ʹBellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch junior,ʹ said
Sirius, in the same brusque voice. ʹRodolphuss brother Rabastan was with them,
too.ʹ 
Then Harry remembered. He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledoreʹs
Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a
tall dark woman with heavy‐lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and
proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had
tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be
rewarded for her loyalty.
ʹYou never said she was your ‐ʹ 
ʹDoes it matter if sheʹs my cousin?ʹ snapped Sirius. ʹAs far as Iʹm concerned,
theyʹre not my family. Sheʹs certainly not my family. I havenʹt seen her since I
was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming into Azkaban. Dʹyou
think Iʹm proud of having a relative like her?ʹ 
ʹSorry,ʹ said Harry quickly, ʹI didnʹt mean ‐ I was just surprised, thatʹs all ‐ʹ 
ʹIt doesnʹt matter, donʹt apologise,ʹ Sirius mumbled. He turned away from the
tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. ʹI donʹt like being back here,ʹ he said,
staring across the drawing room. ʹI never thought Iʹd be stuck in this house
again.ʹ 
Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel, when he was grown
up and thought he was free of the place for ever, to return and live at number
four, Privet Drive.
ʹItʹs ideal for Headquarters, of course,ʹ Sirius said. ʹMy father put every security
measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here. Itʹs unplottable, so
Muggles could never come and call ‐ as if theyʹd ever have wanted to ‐ and now
Dumbledoreʹs added his protection, youʹd be hard put to find a safer house
anywhere. Dumbledore is Secret Keeper for the Order, you know ‐ nobody can
find Headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is ‐ that note Moody
showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore…ʹ Sirius gave a short, bark‐
like laugh. ʹIf my parents could see the use their house was being put to now…
well, my mothers portrait should give you some idea
He scowled for a moment, then sighed.
ʹI wouldnʹt mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. Iʹve
asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing ‐ as Snuffles,
obviously ‐ so I can give you a bit of moral support, what dʹyou think?ʹ 
Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not
thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the
excitement of being back with the people he liked best, and hearing everything
that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Siriusʹs words, however,
the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the
Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if
they went back to Hogwarts without him.
ʹDonʹt worry,ʹ Sirius said. Harry looked up and realised that Sirius had been
watching him. ʹIʹm sure theyʹll clear you, thereʹs definitely something in the
International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your
own life.ʹ 
ʹBut if they do expel me,ʹ said Harry quietly, ʹcan I come back here and live with
you?ʹ 
Sirius smiled sadly.
ʹWeʹll see.ʹ 
ʹIʹd feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didnʹt have to go back to the
Dursleysʹ,ʹ Harry pressed him.
ʹThey must be bad if you prefer this place,ʹ said Sirius gloomily.
ʹHurry up, you two, or there wonʹt be any food left,ʹ Mrs Weasley called.
Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, then he and
Harry went to join the others.
Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass‐
fronted cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a
lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to
leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox;
within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like
a tough brown glove.
ʹIts OK,ʹ he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with
his wand and restoring its skin to normal, ʹmust be Wartcap powder in there.ʹ 
He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from
the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments
later and sneak the box into his already Doxy‐filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant‐looking silver instrument, something like a many‐
legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harrys arm like a spider when he
picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it
with a heavy book entitled Natureʹs Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a
musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they
all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the
sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number
of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had
been awarded to Siriusʹs grandfather for ʹservices to the Ministryʹ.
ʹIt means he gave them a load of gold,ʹ said Sirius contemptuously, throwing the
medal into the rubbish sack.
Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things
away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him
at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his
grip, Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under
his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before.
ʹIt was my fatherʹs,ʹ said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. ʹKreacher wasnʹt
quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but w still caught him snogging a pair of
my fatherʹs old trousers last week.ʹ 
Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. The drawing
room took three days to decontaminate. Finally, the only undesirable things left
in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to
remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk. Moody had not dropped by
Headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it.
They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where
they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room
hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half). The
china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously
into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished
silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them
smashed.
Snape might refer to their work as ʹcleaningʹ, but in Harrys opinion they were
really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided
and abetted by Kreacher. The house‐elf kept appearing wherever they were
congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted
to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to
threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said,
ʹMaster must do as Master wishes,ʹ before turning away and muttering very
loudly, ʹbut Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows
what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these
Mudbloods and traitors and scum…ʹ 
At which Sirius, ignoring Hermioneʹs protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his
loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Siriusʹs mother to
start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on
the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches
of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs Weasley recalled them to
their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to
Harryʹs relief they never came face to face; Harry also caught sight of his
Transfiguration teacher Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle
dress and coat, and she also seemed too busy to linger. Sometimes, however, the
visitors stayed to help. Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which
they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who
was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do
mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had
developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers‐by.
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs Weasleyʹs eyes by rescuing Ron
from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he
removed them from their wardrobe.
Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about
corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to
have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was busy he was happy;
when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay
exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought
of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like
needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled.
The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and
Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting
anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes,
he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official
who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleysʹ…
but he would not go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to
Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius.
He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs Weasley
turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, ʹIʹve
ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash
your hair tonight, too. A good first impression can work wonders.ʹ 
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at
him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop, but his mouth had become
so dry he could not chew.
ʹHow am I getting there?ʹ he asked Mrs Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned.
ʹArthurs taking you to work with him,ʹ said Mrs Weasley gently.
Mr Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.
ʹYou can wait in my office until itʹs time for the hearing,ʹ he said.
Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs Weasley
had answered it.
ʹProfessor Dumbledore doesnʹt think itʹs a good idea for Sirius to go with you,
and I must say I ‐ʹ 
ʹ‐ think heʹs quite right,ʹ said Sirius through clenched teeth.
Mrs Weasley pursed her lips.
ʹWhen did Dumbledore tell you that?ʹ Harry said, staring at Sirius.
ʹHe came last night, when you were in bed,ʹ said Mr Weasley.
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry lowered his own eyes to
his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his
hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if it were possible, even worse.

CHAPTER SEVEN
THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Harry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if
somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of
the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he
leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered
jeans and Tshirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on
the wall sniggered.
Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not
stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly
behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no 
longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the
heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and down into the kitchen.
He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of
voices on the other side. He pushed it open and saw Mr and Mrs Weasley, Sirius, Lupin
and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully
dressed except Mrs Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She leapt
to her feet the moment Harry entered.
"Breakfast," she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire.
"M  m  morning, Harry," yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning.
"Sleep all right?"
"Yeah," said Harry.
"I've b  b  been up all night," she said, with another shuddering yawn. "Come and sit
down ..."
She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.
"What do you want, Harry?" Mrs Weasley called. "Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon
and eggs? Toast?"
"Just  just toast, thanks," said Harry.
Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, "What were you saying about Scrimgeour?"
"Oh ... yeah ... well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me
funny questions ..."
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His
insides were squirming. Mrs Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade
in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs Weasley sat down on
his other side and started fussing with his Tshirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out
the creases across his shoulders. He wished she wouldn't.
"... and I'll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow, I'm just too tired,"
Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.
"I'll cover for you," said Mr Weasley. "I'm OK, I've got a report to finish anyway
Mr Weasley was not wearing wizards' robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old
bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry.
"How are you feeling?" 
Harry shrugged.
"It'll all be over soon," Mr Weasley said bracingly. In a few hours' time you'll be
cleared."
Harry said nothing.
The hearing's on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office. She's Head of the Department of
Magical Law Enforcement, and the one who'll be questioning you."
"Amelia Bones is OK, Harry," said Tonks earnestly. "She's fair, she'll hear you out."
Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.
"Don't lose your temper," said Sirius abruptly. "Be polite and stick to the facts."
Harry nodded again.
"The law's on your side," said Lupin quietly. "Even underage wizards are allowed to use
magic in lifethreatening situations."
Something very cold trickled down the back of Harrys neck; for a moment he thought
someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him, then he realised that Mrs Weasley
was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.
"Doesn't it ever lie flat?" she said desperately.
Harry shook his head.
Mr Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry.
"I think we'll go now," he said. "We're a bit early but I think you'll be better off at the
Ministry than hanging around here."
"OK," said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet.
"You'll be all right, Harry," said Tonks, patting him on the arm.
"Good luck," said Lupin. I'm sure it will be fine."
"And if it's not," said Sirius grimly "I'll see to Amelia Bones for you ..."
Harry smiled weakly. Mrs Weasley hugged him.
"We've all got our fingers crossed," she said. 
"Right," said Harry. "Well ... see you later then."
He followed Mr Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius's mother
grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped
out into the cold, grey dawn.
"You don't normally walk to work, do you?" Harry asked him, as they set off briskly
around the square.
"No, I usually Apparate," said Mr Weasley, "but obviously you can't, and I think it's best
we arrive in a thoroughly nonmagical fashion ... makes a better impression, given what
you're being disciplined for ..."
Mr Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched
around his wand. The rundown streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the
miserable little underground station they found it already full of earlymorning
commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about
their daily business, Mr Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.
"Simply fabulous," he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. "Wonderfully
ingenious."
"They're out of order," said Harry, pointing at the sign.
"Yes, but even so ..." said Mr Weasley, beaming at them fondly
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepylooking guard (Harry handled the
transaction, as Mr Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes
later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of
London. Mr Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground Map
above the windows.
"Four more stops, Harry ... Three stops left now ... Two stops to go, Harry ..."
They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a
tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they went, through
the ticket barrier (Mr Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and
emerged on to a broad street lined with imposinglooking buildings and already full of
traffic.
"Where are we?" said Mr Weasley blankly, and for one heartstopping moment Harry
thought they had got off at the wrong station despite Mr Weasley's continual references
to the map; but a second later he said, "Ah yes ... this way, Harry," and led him down a
side road. 
"Sorry," he said, "but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a
Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact, I've never even used the visitors' entrance
before."
The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally
they reached a street that contained several rather shabbylooking offices, a pub and an
overflowing skip. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry
of Magic.
"Here we are," said Mr Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which
was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall. "After you,
Harry."
He opened the telephonebox door.
Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr Weasley folded
himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against
the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal
had tried to rip it off. Mr Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.
"Mr Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too," Harry said.
"No, no, I'm sure it's fine," said Mr Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and
peering at the dial. "Let's see ... six ..." he dialled the number, "two ... four ... and another
four ... and another two ..."
As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the
telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as
though an invisible woman were standing right beside them.
"Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business."
"Er ..." said Mr Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver.
He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, "Arthur Weasley, Misuse of
Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a
disciplinary hearing ..."
"Thank you," said the cool female voice. "Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to
the front of your robes."
There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute
where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: it was a square silver badge with
Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his Tshirt as the
female voice spoke again. 
"Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for
registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium."
The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground.
Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows
of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at
all; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down
through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of
golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the
face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering.
"The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day," said the woman's voice.
ʹYeah,ʹ said Fred slowly. ʹYeah, youʹve caused too much trouble, mate. Well, at
least one of youʹs got their priorities right.ʹ 
He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a
scathing look.
ʹPrefect… ickle Ronnie the Prefect.ʹ 
ʹOhh, Mumʹs going to be revolting,ʹ groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge
back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.
Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment,
then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was
genuine. Harry took it. A large Tʹ was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He
had seen a badge just like this on Percys chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.
The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed
