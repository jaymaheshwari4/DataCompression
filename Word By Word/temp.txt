• Average / Best case : when the tree is balanced or nearly balanced. Worst Case When skewed. Compression Consider an Input file of ‘X’ symbols (characters). Let’s say total number distinct characters in our ‘N’. (construction) and (encoding) The construction FGK encoding happens hand to hand. Initally a character encountered, its occurrence checked tree(we are doing it through map so takes O(log N) time). If there then positioned searched which time avg O(N) worst case. after that code generated also same time(O(log case). And Thn updated requires searching for order greater than equal current node taking both operation from bottom down(Updation order) thn swapping nodes happen O(1) time. else{ NYT ascii symbol printed thm by adding new case.} So Time taken reading Printing encoded message X*(O(logN)+O(LogN)+O(1))=O(X*logN) X*(O(logN)+O(N)+O(1)=O(X*N) Decoding similar way, as at any moment structure encoder decoder. Let length bit stream be S. After we traverse accordingly(go left child if '0' encountered otherwise go right) reach leaf this signifies have been not hence read next 8 bits print according value update tree(add node) case.(This comples=xity written into consideration serching nodes:O(1)) with frequency symbol. Updation along finding nodes, required } Hence decoding: Avg case: S*O(LogN)=O(S*logN) S*O(N)=O(S*N) Space Complexity space Tree = N extra (maps, other local variables, etc) bounded N. Hence, complexity O(N).
