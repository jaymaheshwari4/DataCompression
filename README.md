# DataCompression
•Compared 5 different Encoding Algorithms based on time taken for Compression/Decompression and the percentage of data compressed.
• Algorithms Used- Run Length Encoding(RLE), Huffman Coding, Arithmetic Coding, Adaptive Huffman and Word by Word Adaptive Huffman (From an IEEE research paper).
• Algorithms were implemented from scratch in C++ and a detailed report of the project was also made.
